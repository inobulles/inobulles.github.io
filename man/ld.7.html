href=#NAME>NAME</a></h2><code class=Nm>ld</code> — <div class=Nd>The GNU Linker</div></section><section class=Sh><h2 class=Sh id=LD><a class=permalink href=#LD>LD</a></h2> This file documents the GNU linker ld version "2.17.50 [FreeBSD] 2007-07-03". <p class=Pp>This document is distributed under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License. A copy of the license is included in the section entitled “GNU Free Documentation License”.</p></section><section class=Sh><h2 class=Sh id=Overview><a class=permalink href=#Overview>Overview</a></h2><a class=Xr href=ld.1.html>ld</a> combines a number of object and archive files, relocates their data and ties up symbol references. Usually the last step in compiling a program is to run <a class=Xr href=ld.1.html>ld</a>. <p class=Pp><a class=Xr href=ld.1.html>ld</a> accepts Linker Command Language files written in a superset of AT&amp;T's Link Editor Command Language syntax, to provide explicit and total control over the linking process.</p><p class=Pp>This version of <a class=Xr href=ld.1.html>ld</a> uses the general purpose BFD libraries to operate on object files. This allows <a class=Xr href=ld.1.html>ld</a> to read, combine, and write object files in many different formats---for example, COFF or <code class=Li>a.out</code>. Different formats may be linked together to produce any available kind of object file.See Section “BFD”, for more information.</p><p class=Pp>Aside from its flexibility, the GNU linker is more helpful than other linkers in providing diagnostic information. Many linkers abandon execution immediately upon encountering an error; whenever possible, <a class=Xr href=ld.1.html>ld</a> continues executing, allowing you to identify other errors (or, in some cases, to get an output file in spite of the error).</p></section><section class=Sh><h2 class=Sh id=Invocation><a class=permalink href=#Invocation>Invocation</a></h2> The GNU linker <a class=Xr href=ld.1.html>ld</a> is meant to cover a broad range of situations, and to be as compatible as possible with other linkers. As a result, you have many choices to control its behavior. <section class=Ss><h2 class=Ss id=Command_Line_Options><a class=permalink href=#Command_Line_Options>Command Line Options</a></h2> The linker supports a plethora of command-line options, but in actual practice few of them are used in any particular context. For instance, a frequent use of <a class=Xr href=ld.1.html>ld</a> is to link standard Unix object files on a standard, supported Unix system. On such a system, to link a file <code class=Li>hello.o</code>: <div class="Bd Pp Bd-indent"><pre>
ld -o output /lib/crt0.o hello.o -lc
</pre></div><p class=Pp>This tells <a class=Xr href=ld.1.html>ld</a> to produce a file called <var class=Va>output</var> as the result of linking the file <code class=Li>/lib/crt0.o</code> with <code class=Li>hello.o</code> and the library <code class=Li>libc.a</code>, which will come from the standard search directories. (See the discussion of the <code class=Li>-l</code> option below.)</p><p class=Pp>Some of the command-line options to <a class=Xr href=ld.1.html>ld</a> may be specified at any point in the command line. However, options which refer to files, such as <code class=Li>-l</code> or <code class=Li>-T</code>, cause the file to be read at the point at which the option appears in the command line, relative to the object files and other file options. Repeating non-file options with a different argument will either have no further effect, or override prior occurrences (those further to the left on the command line) of that option. Options which may be meaningfully specified more than once are noted in the descriptions below.</p><p class=Pp>Non-option arguments are object files or archives which are to be linked together. They may follow, precede, or be mixed in with command-line options, except that an object file argument may not be placed between an option and its argument.</p><p class=Pp>Usually the linker is invoked with at least one object file, but you can specify other forms of binary input files using <code class=Li>-l</code>, <code class=Li>-R</code>, and the script command language. If <i class=Em>no</i> binary input files at all are specified, the linker does not produce any output, and issues the message <span class=No>input files</span>.</p><p class=Pp>If the linker cannot recognize the format of an object file, it will assume that it is a linker script. A script specified in this way augments the main linker script used for the link (either the default linker script or the one specified by using <code class=Li>-T</code>). This feature permits the linker to link against a file which appears to be an object or an archive, but actually merely defines some symbol values, or uses <code class=Li>INPUT</code> or <code class=Li>GROUP</code> to load other objects. Note that specifying a script in this way merely augments the main linker script; use the <code class=Li>-T</code> option to replace the default linker script entirely.See Section “Scripts”.</p><p class=Pp>For options whose names are a single letter, option arguments must either follow the option letter without intervening whitespace, or be given as separate arguments immediately following the option that requires them.</p><p class=Pp>For options whose names are multiple letters, either one dash or two can precede the option name; for example, <code class=Li>-trace-symbol</code> and <code class=Li>--trace-symbol</code> are equivalent. Note---there is one exception to this rule. Multiple letter options that start with a lower case 'o' can only be preceded by two dashes. This is to reduce confusion with the <code class=Li>-o</code> option. So for example <code class=Li>-omagic</code> sets the output file name to <code class=Li>magic</code> whereas <code class=Li>--omagic</code> sets the NMAGIC flag on the output.</p><p class=Pp>Arguments to multiple-letter options must either be separated from the option name by an equals sign, or be given as separate arguments immediately following the option that requires them. For example, <code class=Li>--trace-symbol foo</code> and <code class=Li>--trace-symbol=foo</code> are equivalent. Unique abbreviations of the names of multiple-letter options are accepted.</p><p class=Pp>Note---if the linker is being invoked indirectly, via a compiler driver (e.g. <code class=Li>gcc</code>) then all the linker command line options should be prefixed by <code class=Li>-Wl,</code> (or whatever is appropriate for the particular compiler driver) like this:</p><div class="Bd Pp Bd-indent"><pre>

This is only meaningful for certain processors, such as the Alpha. Specifically, some processors put large-valued constants in a special section. A special register (the global pointer) points into the middle of this section, so that constants can be loaded efficiently via a base-register relative addressing mode. Since the offset in base-register relative mode is fixed and relatively small (e.g., 16 bits), this limits the maximum size of the constant pool. Thus, in large programs, it is often necessary to use multiple global pointer values in order to be able to address all possible constants.

When you do this, your linker script will replace the default linker script.</p><p class=Pp>You may also use linker scripts implicitly by naming them as input files to the linker, as though they were files to be linked.See Section “Implicit Linker Scripts”.</p><section class=Ss><h2 class=Ss id=Basic_Linker_Script_Concepts><a class=permalink href=#Basic_Linker_Script_Concepts>Basic Linker Script Concepts</a></h2> We need to define some basic concepts and vocabulary in order to describe the linker script language. <p class=Pp>The linker combines input files into a single output file. The output file and each input file are in a special data format known as an <i class=Em>object file format</i>. Each file is called an <i class=Em>object file</i>. The output file is often called an <i class=Em>executable</i>, but for our purposes we will also call it an object file. Each object file has, among other things, a list of <i class=Em>sections</i>. We sometimes refer to a section in an input file as an <i class=Em>input section</i>; similarly, a section in the output file is an <i class=Em>output section</i>.</p><p class=Pp>Each section in an object file has a name and a size. Most sections also have an associated block of data, known as the <i class=Em>section contents</i>. A section may be marked as <i class=Em>loadable</i>, which mean that the contents should be loaded into memory when the output file is run. A section with no contents may be <i class=Em>allocatable</i>, which means that an area in memory should be set aside, but nothing in particular should be loaded there (in some cases this memory must be zeroed out). A section which is neither loadable nor allocatable typically contains some sort of debugging information.</p><p class=Pp>Every loadable or allocatable output section has two addresses. The first is the <i class=Em>VMA</i>, or virtual memory address. This is the address the section will have when the output file is run. The second is the <i class=Em>LMA</i>, or load memory address. This is the address at which the section will be loaded. In most cases the two addresses will be the same. An example of when they might be different is when a data section is loaded into ROM, and then copied into RAM when the program starts up (this technique is often used to initialize global variables in a ROM based system). In this case the ROM address would be the LMA, and the RAM address would be the VMA.</p><p class=Pp>You can see the sections in an object file by using the <code class=Li>objdump</code> program with the <code class=Li>-h</code> option.</p><p class=Pp>Every object file also has a list of <i class=Em>symbols</i>, known as the <i class=Em>symbol table</i>. A symbol may be defined or undefined. Each symbol has a name, and each defined symbol has an address, among other information. If you compile a C or C++ program into an object file, you will get a defined symbol for every defined function and global or static variable. Every undefined function or global variable which is referenced in the input file will become an undefined symbol.</p><p class=Pp>You can see the symbols in an object file by using the <code class=Li>nm</code> program, or by using the <code class=Li>objdump</code> program with the <code class=Li>-t</code> option.</p></section><section class=Ss><h2 class=Ss id=Linker_Script_Format><a class=permalink href=#Linker_Script_Format>Linker Script Format</a></h2> Linker scripts are text files. <p class=Pp>You write a linker script as a series of commands. Each command is either a keyword, possibly followed by arguments, or an assignment to a symbol. You may separate commands using semicolons. Whitespace is generally ignored.</p><p class=Pp>Strings such as file or format names can normally be entered directly. If the file name contains a character such as a comma which would otherwise serve to separate file names, you may put the file name in double quotes. There is no way to use a double quote character in a file name.</p><p class=Pp>You may include comments in linker scripts just as in C, delimited by <code class=Li>/*</code> and <code class=Li>*/</code>. As in C, comments are syntactically equivalent to whitespace.</p></section><section class=Ss><h2 class=Ss id=Simple_Linker_Script_Example><a class=permalink href=#Simple_Linker_Script_Example>Simple Linker Script Example</a></h2> Many linker scripts are fairly simple. <p class=Pp>The simplest possible linker script has just one command: <code class=Li>SECTIONS</code>. You use the <code class=Li>SECTIONS</code> command to describe the memory layout of the output file.</p><p class=Pp>The <code class=Li>SECTIONS</code> command is a powerful command. Here we will describe a simple use of it. Let's assume your program consists only of code, initialized data, and uninitialized data. These will be in the <code class=Li>.text</code>, <code class=Li>.data</code>, and <code class=Li>.bss</code> sections, respectively. Let's assume further that these are the only sections which appear in your input files.</p><p class=Pp>For this example, let's say that the code should be loaded at address 0x10000, and that the data should start at address 0x8000000. Here is a linker script which will do that:</p><div class="Bd Pp Bd-indent"><pre>
SECTIONS
{
  . = 0x10000;
  .text : { *(.text) }
  . = 0x8000000;
  .data : { *(.data) }
  .bss : { *(.bss) }
}
</pre></div><p class=Pp>You write the <code class=Li>SECTIONS</code> command as the keyword <code class=Li>SECTIONS</code>, followed by a series of symbol assignments and output section descriptions enclosed in curly braces.</p><p class=Pp>The first line inside the <code class=Li>SECTIONS</code> command of the above example sets the value of the special symbol ., which is the location counter. If you do not specify the address of an output section in some other way (other ways are described later), the address is set from the current value of the location counter. The location counter is then incremented by the size of the output section. At the start of the <code class=Li>SECTIONS</code> command, the location counter has the value <code class=Li>0</code>.</p><p class=Pp>The second line defines an output section, <code class=Li>.text</code>. The colon is required syntax which may be ignored for now. Within the curly braces after the output section name, you list the names of the input sections which should be placed into this output section. The <code class=Li>*</code> is a wildcard which matches any file name. The expression <code class=Li>*(.text)</code> means all <code class=Li>.text</code> input sections in all input files.</p><p class=Pp>Since the location counter is <code class=Li>0x10000</code> when the output section <code class=Li>.text</code> is defined, the linker will set the address of the <code class=Li>.text</code> section in the output file to be <code class=Li>0x10000</code>.</p><p class=Pp>The remaining lines define the <code class=Li>.data</code> and <code class=Li>.bss</code> sections in the output file. The linker will place the <code class=Li>.data</code> output section at address <code class=Li>0x8000000</code>. After the linker places the <code class=Li>.data</code> output section, the value of the location counter will be <code class=Li>0x8000000</code> plus the size of the <code class=Li>.data</code> output section. The effect is that the linker will place the <code class=Li>.bss</code> output section immediately after the <code class=Li>.data</code> output section in memory.</p><p class=Pp>The linker will ensure that each output section has the required alignment, by increasing the location counter if necessary. In this example, the specified addresses for the <code class=Li>.text</code> and <code class=Li>.data</code> sections will probably satisfy any alignment constraints, but the linker may have to create a small gap between the <code class=Li>.data</code> and <code class=Li>.bss</code> sections.</p><p class=Pp>That's it!

For example, traditional linkers defined the symbol <code class=Li>etext</code>. However, ANSI C requires that the user be able to use <code class=Li>etext</code> as a function name without encountering an error. The <code class=Li>PROVIDE</code> keyword may be used to define a symbol, such as <code class=Li>etext</code>, only if it is referenced but not defined. The syntax is <code class=Li>PROVIDE(</code><var class=Va>symbol =</var><var class=Va>expression)</var>.</p><p class=Pp>Here is an example of using <code class=Li>PROVIDE</code> to define <code class=Li>etext</code>:</p><div class="Bd Pp Bd-indent"><pre>
SECTIONS
{
  .text :
    {
      *(.text)
      _etext = .;
      PROVIDE(etext = .);
    }
}
</pre></div><p class=Pp>In this example, if the program defines <code class=Li>_etext</code> (with a leading underscore), the linker will give a multiple definition error. If, on the other hand, the program defines <code class=Li>etext</code> (with no leading underscore), the linker will silently use the definition in the program. If the program references <code class=Li>etext</code> but does not define it, the linker will use the definition in the linker script.</p><p class=Pp><i class=Em>PROVIDE_HIDDEN</i></p><p class=Pp>Similar to <code class=Li>PROVIDE</code>. For ELF targeted ports, the symbol will be hidden and won't be exported.</p><p class=Pp><i class=Em>Source Code Reference</i></p><p class=Pp>Accessing a linker script defined variable from source code is not intuitive. In particular a linker script symbol is not equivalent to a variable declaration in a high level language, it is instead a symbol that does not have a value.</p><p class=Pp>Before going further, it is important to note that compilers often transform names in the source code into different names when they are stored in the symbol table. For example, Fortran compilers commonly prepend or append an underscore, and C++ performs extensive <code class=Li>name mangling</code>. Therefore there might be a discrepancy between the name of a variable as it is used in source code and the name of the same variable as it is defined in a linker script. For example in C a linker script variable might be referred to as:</p><div class="Bd Pp Bd-indent"><pre>
  extern int foo;
</pre></div><p class=Pp>But in the linker script it might be defined as:</p><div class="Bd Pp Bd-indent"><pre>
  _foo = 1000;
</pre></div><p class=Pp>In the remaining examples however it is assumed that no name transformation has taken place.</p><p class=Pp>When a symbol is declared in a high level language such as C, two things happen. The first is that the compiler reserves enough space in the program's memory to hold the <i class=Em>value</i> of the symbol. The second is that the compiler creates an entry in the program's symbol table which holds the symbol's <i class=Em>address</i>. ie the symbol table contains the address of the block of memory holding the symbol's value. So for example the following C declaration, at file scope:</p><div class="Bd Pp Bd-indent"><pre>
  int foo = 1000;
</pre></div><p class=Pp>creates a entry called <code class=Li>foo</code> in the symbol table. This entry holds the address of an <code class=Li>int</code> sized block of memory where the number 1000 is initially stored.</p><p class=Pp>When a program references a symbol the compiler generates code that first accesses the symbol table to find the address of the symbol's memory block and then code to read the value from that memory block. So:</p><div class="Bd Pp Bd-indent"><pre>
  foo = 1;
</pre></div><p class=Pp>looks up the symbol <code class=Li>foo</code> in the symbol table, gets the address associated with this symbol and then writes the value 1 into that address. Whereas:</p><div class="Bd Pp Bd-indent"><pre>
  int * a = &amp; foo;
</pre></div><p class=Pp>looks up the symbol <code class=Li>foo</code> in the symbol table, gets it address and then copies this address into the block of memory associated with the variable <code class=Li>a</code>.</p><p class=Pp>Linker scripts symbol declarations, by contrast, create an entry in the symbol table but do not assign any memory to them. Thus they are an address without a value. So for example the linker script definition:</p><div class="Bd Pp Bd-indent"><pre>
  foo = 1000;
</pre></div><p class=Pp>creates an entry in the symbol table called <code class=Li>foo</code> which holds the address of memory location 1000, but nothing special is stored at address 1000. This means that you cannot access the <i class=Em>value</i> of a linker script defined symbol - it has no value - all you can do is access the <i class=Em>address</i> of a linker script defined symbol.</p><p class=Pp>Hence when you are using a linker script defined symbol in source code you should always take the address of the symbol, and never attempt to use its value. For example suppose you want to copy the contents of a section of memory called .ROM into a section called .FLASH and the linker script contains these declarations:</p><div class="Bd Pp Bd-indent"><pre>

  start_of_ROM   = .ROM;
  end_of_ROM     = .ROM + sizeof (.ROM) - 1;
  start_of_FLASH = .FLASH;

</pre></div><p class=Pp>Then the C source code to perform the copy would be:</p><div class="Bd Pp Bd-indent"><pre>

  extern char start_of_ROM, end_of_ROM, start_of_FLASH;

  memcpy (&amp; start_of_FLASH, &amp; start_of_ROM, &amp; end_of_ROM - &amp; start_of_ROM);

</pre></div><p class=Pp>Note the use of the <code class=Li>&amp;</code> operators.

</pre></div><p class=Pp>Most output sections do not use most of the optional section attributes.</p><p class=Pp>The whitespace around <var class=Va>section</var> is required, so that the section name is unambiguous.

The line breaks and other white space are optional.</p><p class=Pp>Each <var class=Va>output-section-command</var> may be one of the following:</p><ul class=Bl-bullet><li>a symbol assignment (see Section “Assignments”)</li><li>an input section description (see Section “Input Section”)</li><li>data values to include directly (see Section “Output Section Data”)</li><li>a special output section keyword (see Section “Output Section Keywords”)</li></ul><p class=Pp><i class=Em>Output Section Name</i></p><p class=Pp>The name of the output section is <var class=Va>section</var>. <var class=Va>section</var> must meet the constraints of your output format. In formats which only support a limited number of sections, such as <code class=Li>a.out</code>, the name must be one of the names supported by the format ( <code class=Li>a.out</code>, for example, allows only <code class=Li>.text</code>, <code class=Li>.data</code> or <code class=Li>.bss</code>). If the output format supports any number of sections, but with numbers and not names (as is the case for Oasys), the name should be supplied as a quoted numeric string. A section name may consist of any sequence of characters, but a name which contains any unusual characters such as commas must be quoted.</p><p class=Pp>The output section name <code class=Li>/DISCARD/</code> is special; Output Section Discarding.</p><p class=Pp><i class=Em>Output Section Address</i></p><p class=Pp>The <var class=Va>address</var> is an expression for the VMA (the virtual memory address) of the output section. If you do not provide <var class=Va>address</var>, the linker will set it based on <var class=Va>region</var> if present, or otherwise based on the current value of the location counter.</p><p class=Pp>If you provide <var class=Va>address</var>, the address of the output section will be set to precisely that. If you provide neither <var class=Va>address</var> nor <var class=Va>region</var>, then the address of the output section will be set to the current value of the location counter aligned to the alignment requirements of the output section. The alignment requirement of the output section is the strictest alignment of any input section contained within the output section.</p><p class=Pp>For example,</p><div class="Bd Pp Bd-indent"><pre>
.text . : { *(.text) }
</pre></div> and <div class="Bd Pp Bd-indent"><pre>
.text : { *(.text) }
</pre></div> are subtly different. The first will set the address of the <code class=Li>.text</code> output section to the current value of the location counter. The second will set it to the current value of the location counter aligned to the strictest alignment of a <code class=Li>.text</code> input section. <p class=Pp>The <var class=Va>address</var> may be an arbitrary expression; Expressions. For example, if you want to align the section on a 0x10 byte boundary, so that the lowest four bits of the section address are zero, you could do something like this:</p><div class="Bd Pp Bd-indent"><pre>
.text ALIGN(0x10) : { *(.text) }
</pre></div> This works because <code class=Li>ALIGN</code> returns the current location counter aligned upward to the specified value. <p class=Pp>Specifying <var class=Va>address</var> for a section will change the value of the location counter.</p><p class=Pp><i class=Em>Input Section Description</i></p><p class=Pp>The most common output section command is an input section description.</p><p class=Pp>The input section description is the most basic linker script operation. You use output sections to tell the linker how to lay out your program in memory. You use input section descriptions to tell the linker how to map the input files into your memory layout.</p><p class=Pp><span class=No>Input Section Basics</span></p><p class=Pp>An input section description consists of a file name optionally followed by a list of section names in parentheses.</p><p class=Pp>The file name and the section name may be wildcard patterns, which we describe further below (see Section “Input Section Wildcards”).</p><p class=Pp>The most common input section description is to include all input sections with a particular name in the output section. For example, to include all input <code class=Li>.text</code> sections, you would write:</p><div class="Bd Pp Bd-indent"><pre>
*(.text)
</pre></div> Here the <code class=Li>*</code> is a wildcard which matches any file name. To exclude a list of files from matching the file name wildcard, EXCLUDE_FILE may be used to match all files except the ones specified in the EXCLUDE_FILE list. For example: <div class="Bd Pp Bd-indent"><pre>
(*(EXCLUDE_FILE (*crtend.o *otherfile.o) .ctors))
</pre></div> will cause all .ctors sections from all files except <span class=Pa>crtend.o</span> and <span class=Pa>otherfile.o</span> to be included. <p class=Pp>There are two ways to include more than one section:</p><div class="Bd Pp Bd-indent"><pre>
*(.text .rdata)
*(.text) *(.rdata)
</pre></div> The difference between these is the order in which the <code class=Li>.text</code> and <code class=Li>.rdata</code> input sections will appear in the output section. In the first example, they will be intermingled, appearing in the same order as they are found in the linker input. In the second example, all <code class=Li>.text</code> input sections will appear first, followed by all <code class=Li>.rdata</code> input sections. <p class=Pp>You can specify a file name to include sections from a particular file. You would do this if one or more of your files contain special data that needs to be at a particular location in memory. For example:</p><div class="Bd Pp Bd-indent"><pre>
data.o(.data)
</pre></div><p class=Pp>If you use a file name without a list of sections, then all sections in the input file will be included in the output section. This is not commonly done, but it may by useful on occasion. For example:</p><div class="Bd Pp Bd-indent"><pre>
data.o
</pre></div><p class=Pp>When you use a file name which does not contain any wild card characters, the linker will first see if you also specified the file name on the linker command line or in an <code class=Li>INPUT</code> command. If you did not, the linker will attempt to open the file as an input file, as though it appeared on the command line. Note that this differs from an <code class=Li>INPUT</code> command, because the linker will not search for the file in the archive search path.</p><p class=Pp><span class=No>Input Section Wildcard Patterns</span></p><p class=Pp>In an input section description, either the file name or the section name or both may be wildcard patterns.</p><p class=Pp>The file name of <code class=Li>*</code> seen in many examples is a simple wildcard pattern for the file name.</p><p class=Pp>The wildcard patterns are like those used by the Unix shell.</p><dl class=Bl-tag><dt>*</dt><dd>matches any number of characters</dd><dt>?</dt><dd>matches any single character</dd> [ <dt><var class=Va>chars]</var></dt><dd>matches a single instance of any of the <var class=Va>chars</var>; the <code class=Li>-</code> character may be used to specify a range of characters, as in <code class=Li>[a-z]</code> to match any lower case letter</dd><dt>\</dt><dd>quotes the following character</dd></dl><p class=Pp>When a file name is matched with a wildcard, the wildcard characters will not match a <code class=Li>/</code> character (used to separate directory names on Unix). A pattern consisting of a single <code class=Li>*</code> character is an exception; it will always match any file name, whether it contains a <code class=Li>/</code> or not. In a section name, the wildcard characters will match a <code class=Li>/</code> character.</p><p class=Pp>File name wildcard patterns only match files which are explicitly specified on the command line or in an <code class=Li>INPUT</code> command. The linker does not search directories to expand wildcards.</p><p class=Pp>If a file name matches more than one wildcard pattern, or if a file name appears explicitly and is also matched by a wildcard pattern, the linker will use the first match in the linker script. For example, this sequence of input section descriptions is probably in error, because the <span class=Pa>data.o</span> rule will not be used:</p><div class="Bd Pp Bd-indent"><pre>
.data : { *(.data) }
.data1 : { data.o(.data) }
</pre></div><p class=Pp>Normally, the linker will place files and sections matched by wildcards in the order in which they are seen during the link. You can change this by using the <code class=Li>SORT_BY_NAME</code> keyword, which appears before a wildcard pattern in parentheses (e.g., <code class=Li>SORT_BY_NAME(.text*)</code>). When the <code class=Li>SORT_BY_NAME</code> keyword is used, the linker will sort the files or sections into ascending order by name before placing them in the output file.</p><p class=Pp><code class=Li>SORT_BY_ALIGNMENT</code> is very similar to <code class=Li>SORT_BY_NAME</code>. The difference is <code class=Li>SORT_BY_ALIGNMENT</code> will sort sections into ascending order by alignment before placing them in the output file.</p><p class=Pp><code class=Li>SORT</code> is an alias for <code class=Li>SORT_BY_NAME</code>.</p><p class=Pp>When there are nested section sorting commands in linker script, there can be at most 1 level of nesting for section sorting commands.</p><ol class=Bl-enum><li><a class=permalink href=#SORT_BY_NAME><code class=Li id=SORT_BY_NAME>SORT_BY_NAME</code></a> ( <code class=Li>SORT_BY_ALIGNMENT</code> (wildcard section pattern)).

This linker script directs the linker to place all <code class=Li>.text</code> sections in <code class=Li>.text</code> and all <code class=Li>.bss</code> sections in <code class=Li>.bss</code>. The linker will place the <code class=Li>.data</code> section from all files beginning with an upper case character in <code class=Li>.DATA</code>; for all other files, the linker will place the <code class=Li>.data</code> section in <code class=Li>.data</code>.</p><div class="Bd Pp Bd-indent"><pre>

</pre></div><p class=Pp><span class=No>Input Section for Common Symbols</span></p><p class=Pp>A special notation is needed for common symbols, because in many object file formats common symbols do not have a particular input section. The linker treats common symbols as though they are in an input section named <code class=Li>COMMON</code>.</p><p class=Pp>You may use file names with the <code class=Li>COMMON</code> section just as with any other input sections. You can use this to place common symbols from a particular input file in one section while common symbols from other input files are placed in another section.</p><p class=Pp>In most cases, common symbols in input files will be placed in the <code class=Li>.bss</code> section in the output file. For example:</p><div class="Bd Pp Bd-indent"><pre>
.bss { *(.bss) *(COMMON) }
</pre></div><p class=Pp>Some object file formats have more than one type of common symbol. For example, the MIPS ELF object file format distinguishes standard common symbols and small common symbols. In this case, the linker will use a different special section name for other types of common symbols. In the case of MIPS ELF, the linker uses <code class=Li>COMMON</code> for standard common symbols and <code class=Li>.scommon</code> for small common symbols. This permits you to map the different types of common symbols into memory at different locations.</p><p class=Pp>You will sometimes see <code class=Li>[COMMON]</code> in old linker scripts. This notation is now considered obsolete. It is equivalent to <code class=Li>*(COMMON)</code>.</p><p class=Pp><span class=No>Input Section and Garbage Collection</span></p><p class=Pp>When link-time garbage collection is in use ( <code class=Li>--gc-sections</code>), it is often useful to mark sections that should not be eliminated.

All of section <code class=Li>.input1</code> from file <span class=Pa>foo.o</span> follows immediately, in the same output section.

</pre></div><p class=Pp><i class=Em>Output Section Data</i></p><p class=Pp>You can include explicit bytes of data in an output section by using <code class=Li>BYTE</code>, <code class=Li>SHORT</code>, <code class=Li>LONG</code>, <code class=Li>QUAD</code>, or <code class=Li>SQUAD</code> as an output section command. Each keyword is followed by an expression in parentheses providing the value to store (see Section “Expressions”). The value of the expression is stored at the current value of the location counter.</p><p class=Pp>The <code class=Li>BYTE</code>, <code class=Li>SHORT</code>, <code class=Li>LONG</code>, and <code class=Li>QUAD</code> commands store one, two, four, and eight bytes (respectively). After storing the bytes, the location counter is incremented by the number of bytes stored.</p><p class=Pp>For example, this will store the byte 1 followed by the four byte value of the symbol <code class=Li>addr</code>:</p><div class="Bd Pp Bd-indent"><pre>
BYTE(1)
LONG(addr)
</pre></div><p class=Pp>When using a 64 bit host or target, <code class=Li>QUAD</code> and <code class=Li>SQUAD</code> are the same; they both store an 8 byte, or 64 bit, value. When both host and target are 32 bits, an expression is computed as 32 bits. In this case <code class=Li>QUAD</code> stores a 32 bit value zero extended to 64 bits, and <code class=Li>SQUAD</code> stores a 32 bit value sign extended to 64 bits.</p><p class=Pp>If the object file format of the output file has an explicit endianness, which is the normal case, the value will be stored in that endianness. When the object file format does not have an explicit endianness, as is true of, for example, S-records, the value will be stored in the endianness of the first input object file.</p><p class=Pp>Note---these commands only work inside a section description and not between them, so the following will produce an error from the linker:</p><div class="Bd Pp Bd-indent"><pre>
SECTIONS { .text : { *(.text) } LONG(1) .data : { *(.data) } }

</pre></div><p class=Pp>You may use the <code class=Li>FILL</code> command to set the fill pattern for the current section. It is followed by an expression in parentheses. Any otherwise unspecified regions of memory within the section (for example, gaps left due to the required alignment of input sections) are filled with the value of the expression, repeated as necessary. A <code class=Li>FILL</code> statement covers memory locations after the point at which it occurs in the section definition; by including more than one <code class=Li>FILL</code> statement, you can have different fill patterns in different parts of an output section.</p><p class=Pp>This example shows how to fill unspecified regions of memory with the value <code class=Li>0x90</code>:</p><div class="Bd Pp Bd-indent"><pre>
FILL(0x90909090)
</pre></div><p class=Pp>The <code class=Li>FILL</code> command is similar to the <code class=Li>=</code><var class=Va>fillexp</var> output section attribute, but it only affects the part of the section following the <code class=Li>FILL</code> command, rather than the entire section. If both are used, the <code class=Li>FILL</code> command takes precedence.See Section “Output Section Fill”, for details on the fill expression.</p><p class=Pp><i class=Em>Output Section Keywords</i></p><p class=Pp>There are a couple of keywords which can appear as output section commands.</p><dl class=Bl-tag><dt>CREATE_OBJECT_SYMBOLS</dt><dd>The command tells the linker to create a symbol for each input file. The name of each symbol will be the name of the corresponding input file. The section of each symbol will be the output section in which the <code class=Li>CREATE_OBJECT_SYMBOLS</code> command appears. <p class=Pp>This is conventional for the a.out object file format. It is not normally used for any other object file format.</p></dd><dt>CONSTRUCTORS</dt><dd>When linking using the a.out object file format, the linker uses an unusual set construct to support C++ global constructors and destructors. When linking object file formats which do not support arbitrary sections, such as ECOFF and XCOFF, the linker will automatically recognize C++ global constructors and destructors by name. For these object file formats, the <code class=Li>CONSTRUCTORS</code> command tells the linker to place constructor information in the output section where the <code class=Li>CONSTRUCTORS</code> command appears. The <code class=Li>CONSTRUCTORS</code> command is ignored for other object file formats. <p class=Pp>The symbol <code class=Li>__CTOR_LIST__</code> marks the start of the global constructors, and the symbol <code class=Li>__CTOR_END__</code> marks the end. Similarly, <code class=Li>__DTOR_LIST__</code> and <code class=Li>__DTOR_END__</code> mark the start and end of the global destructors. The first word in the list is the number of entries, followed by the address of each constructor or destructor, followed by a zero word. The compiler must arrange to actually run the code. For these object file formats GNU C++ normally calls constructors from a subroutine <code class=Li>__main</code>; a call to <code class=Li>__main</code> is automatically inserted into the startup code for <code class=Li>main</code>. GNU C++ normally runs destructors either by using <code class=Li>atexit</code>, or directly from the function <code class=Li>exit</code>.</p><p class=Pp>For object file formats such as <code class=Li>COFF</code> or <code class=Li>ELF</code> which support arbitrary section names, GNU C++ will normally arrange to put the addresses of global constructors and destructors into the <code class=Li>.ctors</code> and <code class=Li>.dtors</code> sections. Placing the following sequence into your linker script will build the sort of table which the GNU C++ runtime code expects to see.</p><div class="Bd Pp Bd-indent"><pre>
      __CTOR_LIST__ = .;
      LONG((__CTOR_END__ - __CTOR_LIST__) / 4 - 2)

      __DTOR_END__ = .;
    </pre></div><p class=Pp>If you are using the GNU C++ support for initialization priority, which provides some control over the order in which global constructors are run, you must sort the constructors at link time to ensure that they are executed in the correct order. When using the <code class=Li>CONSTRUCTORS</code> command, use <code class=Li>SORT_BY_NAME(CONSTRUCTORS)</code> instead. When using the <code class=Li>.ctors</code> and <code class=Li>.dtors</code> sections, use <code class=Li>*(SORT_BY_NAME(.ctors))</code> and <code class=Li>*(SORT_BY_NAME(.dtors))</code> instead of just <code class=Li>*(.ctors)</code> and <code class=Li>*(.dtors)</code>.</p><p class=Pp>Normally the compiler and linker will handle these issues automatically, and you will not need to concern yourself with them. However, you may need to consider this if you are using C++ and writing your own linker scripts.</p></dd></dl><p class=Pp><i class=Em>Output Section Discarding</i></p><p class=Pp>The linker will not create output sections with no contents. This is for convenience when referring to input sections that may or may not be present in any of the input files. For example:</p><div class="Bd Pp Bd-indent"><pre>
.foo : { *(.foo) }
</pre></div> will only create a <code class=Li>.foo</code> section in the output file if there is a <code class=Li>.foo</code> section in at least one input file, and if the input sections are not all empty. Other link script directives that allocate space in an output section will also create the output section. <p class=Pp>The linker will ignore address assignments (see Section “Output Section Address”) on discarded output sections, except when the linker script defines symbols in the output section. In that case the linker will obey the address assignments, possibly advancing dot even though the section is discarded.</p><p class=Pp>The special output section name <code class=Li>/DISCARD/</code> may be used to discard input sections. Any input sections which are assigned to an output section named <code class=Li>/DISCARD/</code> are not included in the output file.</p><p class=Pp><i class=Em>Output Section Attributes</i></p><p class=Pp>We showed above that the full description of an output section looked like this:</p><div class="Bd Pp Bd-indent"><pre>

section [address] [(type)] :
  [AT(lma)] [ALIGN(section_align)] [SUBALIGN(subsection_align)]
  {
    output-section-command

</pre></div> We've already described <var class=Va>section</var>, <var class=Va>address</var>, and <var class=Va>output-section-command</var>. In this section we will describe the remaining section attributes. <p class=Pp><span class=No>Output Section Type</span></p><p class=Pp>Each output section may have a type. The type is a keyword in parentheses. The following types are defined:</p><dl class=Bl-tag><dt>NOLOAD</dt><dd>The section should be marked as not loadable, so that it will not be loaded into memory when the program is run.</dd><dt>DSECT</dt><dd style="width: auto;"> </dd><dt>COPY</dt><dd style="width: auto;"> </dd><dt>INFO</dt><dd style="width: auto;"> </dd><dt>OVERLAY</dt><dd>These type names are supported for backward compatibility, and are rarely used. They all have the same effect: the section should be marked as not allocatable, so that no memory is allocated for the section when the program is run.</dd></dl><p class=Pp>The linker normally sets the attributes of an output section based on the input sections which map into it. You can override this by using the section type. For example, in the script sample below, the <code class=Li>ROM</code> section is addressed at memory location <code class=Li>0</code> and does not need to be loaded when the program is run. The contents of the <code class=Li>ROM</code> section will appear in the linker output file as usual.</p><div class="Bd Pp Bd-indent"><pre>

</pre></div><p class=Pp><span class=No>Output Section LMA</span></p><p class=Pp>Every section has a virtual address (VMA) and a load address (LMA); see Basic Script Concepts. The address expression which may appear in an output section description sets the VMA (see Section “Output Section Address”).</p><p class=Pp>The expression <var class=Va>lma</var> that follows the <code class=Li>AT</code> keyword specifies the load address of the section.</p><p class=Pp>Alternatively, with <code class=Li>AT&gt;</code><var class=Va>lma_region</var> expression, you may specify a memory region for the section's load address.See Section “MEMORY”. Note that if the section has not had a VMA assigned to it then the linker will use the <var class=Va>lma_region</var> as the VMA region as well.</p><p class=Pp>If neither <code class=Li>AT</code> nor <code class=Li>AT&gt;</code> is specified for an allocatable section, the linker will set the LMA such that the difference between VMA and LMA for the section is the same as the preceding output section in the same region. If there is no preceding output section or the section is not allocatable, the linker will set the LMA equal to the VMA.See Section “Output Section Region”.</p><p class=Pp>This feature is designed to make it easy to build a ROM image. For example, the following linker script creates three output sections: one called <code class=Li>.text</code>, which starts at <code class=Li>0x1000</code>, one called <code class=Li>.mdata</code>, which is loaded at the end of the <code class=Li>.text</code> section even though its VMA is <code class=Li>0x2000</code>, and one called <code class=Li>.bss</code> to hold uninitialized data at address <code class=Li>0x3000</code>. The symbol <code class=Li>_data</code> is defined with the value <code class=Li>0x2000</code>, which shows that the location counter holds the VMA value, not the LMA value.</p><div class="Bd Pp Bd-indent"><pre>

You can specify which symbols are bound to which version nodes, and you can reduce a specified set of symbols to local scope so that they are not globally visible outside of the shared library.</p><p class=Pp>The easiest way to demonstrate the version script language is with a few examples.</p><div class="Bd Pp Bd-indent"><pre>

</pre></div><p class=Pp>This example version script defines three version nodes. The first version node defined is <code class=Li>VERS_1.1</code>; it has no other dependencies. The script binds the symbol <code class=Li>foo1</code> to <code class=Li>VERS_1.1</code>. It reduces a number of symbols to local scope so that they are not visible outside of the shared library; this is done using wildcard patterns, so that any symbol whose name begins with <code class=Li>old</code>, <code class=Li>original</code>, or <code class=Li>new</code> is matched. The wildcard patterns available are the same as those used in the shell when matching filenames (also known as “globbing”). However, if you specify the symbol name inside double quotes, then the name is treated as literal, rather than as a glob pattern.</p><p class=Pp>Next, the version script defines node <code class=Li>VERS_1.2</code>. This node depends upon <code class=Li>VERS_1.1</code>. The script binds the symbol <code class=Li>foo2</code> to the version node <code class=Li>VERS_1.2</code>.</p><p class=Pp>Finally, the version script defines node <code class=Li>VERS_2.0</code>. This node depends upon <code class=Li>VERS_1.2</code>.

You can bind all otherwise unspecified symbols to a given version node by using <code class=Li>global: *;</code> somewhere in the version script.</p><p class=Pp>The names of the version nodes have no specific meaning other than what they might suggest to the person reading them. The <code class=Li>2.0</code> version could just as well have appeared in between <code class=Li>1.1</code> and <code class=Li>1.2</code>. However, this would be a confusing way to write a version script.</p><p class=Pp>Node name can be omitted, provided it is the only version node in the version script.

{ global: foo; bar; local: *; };
</pre></div><p class=Pp>When you link an application against a shared library that has versioned symbols, the application itself knows which version of each symbol it requires, and it also knows which version nodes it needs from each shared library it is linked against. Thus at runtime, the dynamic loader can make a quick check to make sure that the libraries you have linked against do in fact supply all of the version nodes that the application will need to resolve all of the dynamic symbols. In this way it is possible for the dynamic linker to know with certainty that all external symbols that it needs will be resolvable without having to search for each symbol reference.</p><p class=Pp>The symbol versioning is in effect a much more sophisticated way of doing minor version checking that SunOS does. The fundamental problem that is being addressed here is that typically references to external functions are bound on an as-needed basis, and are not all bound when the application starts up. If a shared library is out of date, a required interface may be missing; when the application tries to use that interface, it may suddenly and unexpectedly fail. With symbol versioning, the user will get a warning when they start their program if the libraries being used with the application are too old.</p><p class=Pp>There are several GNU extensions to Sun's versioning approach. The first of these is the ability to bind a symbol to a version node in the source file where the symbol is defined instead of in the versioning script. This was done mainly to reduce the burden on the library maintainer. You can do this by putting something like:</p><div class="Bd Pp Bd-indent"><pre>
__asm__(".symver original_foo,foo@VERS_1.1");
</pre></div> in the C source file. This renames the function <code class=Li>original_foo</code> to be an alias for <code class=Li>foo</code> bound to the version node <code class=Li>VERS_1.1</code>. The <code class=Li>local:</code> directive can be used to prevent the symbol <code class=Li>original_foo</code> from being exported. A <code class=Li>.symver</code> directive takes precedence over a version script. <p class=Pp>The second GNU extension is to allow multiple versions of the same function to appear in a given shared library. In this way you can make an incompatible change to an interface without increasing the major version number of the shared library, while still allowing applications linked against the old interface to continue to function.</p><p class=Pp>To do this, you must use multiple <code class=Li>.symver</code> directives in the source file. Here is an example:</p><div class="Bd Pp Bd-indent"><pre>
__asm__(".symver original_foo,foo@");
__asm__(".symver old_foo,foo@VERS_1.1");
__asm__(".symver old_foo1,foo@VERS_1.2");
__asm__(".symver new_foo,foo@@VERS_2.0");
</pre></div><p class=Pp>In this example, <code class=Li>foo@</code> represents the symbol <code class=Li>foo</code> bound to the unspecified base version of the symbol. The source file that contains this example would define 4 C functions: <code class=Li>original_foo</code>, <code class=Li>old_foo</code>, <code class=Li>old_foo1</code>, and <code class=Li>new_foo</code>.</p><p class=Pp>When you have multiple definitions of a given symbol, there needs to be some way to specify a default version to which external references to this symbol will be bound. You can do this with the <code class=Li>foo@@VERS_2.0</code> type of <code class=Li>.symver</code> directive. You can only declare one version of a symbol as the default in this manner; otherwise you would effectively have multiple definitions of the same symbol.</p><p class=Pp>If you wish to bind a reference to a specific version of the symbol within the shared library, you can use the aliases of convenience (i.e., <code class=Li>old_foo</code>), or you can use the <code class=Li>.symver</code> directive to specifically bind to an external version of the function in question.</p><p class=Pp>You can also specify the language in the version script:</p><div class="Bd Pp Bd-indent"><pre>
VERSION extern "lang" { version-script-commands }
</pre></div><p class=Pp>The supported <code class=Li>lang</code> s are <code class=Li>C</code>, <code class=Li>C++</code>, and <code class=Li>Java</code>.

As described above, you can use a glob pattern to match demangled names, or you can use a double-quoted string to match the string exactly. In the latter case, be aware that minor differences (such as differing whitespace) between the version script and the demangler output will cause a mismatch.

All expressions are evaluated in the same size, which is 32 bits if both the host and target are 32 bits, and is otherwise 64 bits. <p class=Pp>You can use and set symbol values in expressions.</p><p class=Pp>The linker defines several special purpose builtin functions for use in expressions.</p><p class=Pp><i class=Em>Constants</i></p><p class=Pp>All constants are integers.</p><p class=Pp>As in C, the linker considers an integer beginning with <code class=Li>0</code> to be octal, and an integer beginning with <code class=Li>0x</code> or <code class=Li>0X</code> to be hexadecimal. The linker considers other integers to be decimal.</p><p class=Pp>In addition, you can use the suffixes <code class=Li>K</code> and <code class=Li>M</code> to scale a constant by <code class=Li>1024</code> or <code class=Li>1024*1024</code> respectively. For example, the following all refer to the same quantity:</p><div class="Bd Pp Bd-indent"><pre>
_fourk_1 = 4K;
_fourk_2 = 4096;
_fourk_3 = 0x1000;
</pre></div><p class=Pp><i class=Em>Symbol Names</i></p><p class=Pp>Unless quoted, symbol names start with a letter, underscore, or period and may include letters, digits, underscores, periods, and hyphens. Unquoted symbol names must not conflict with any keywords. You can specify a symbol which contains odd characters or has the same name as a keyword by surrounding the symbol name in double quotes:</p><div class="Bd Pp Bd-indent"><pre>
"SECTION" = 9;
"with a space" = "also with a space" + 10;
</pre></div><p class=Pp>Since symbols can contain many non-alphabetic characters, it is safest to delimit symbols with spaces. For example, <code class=Li>A-B</code> is one symbol, whereas <code class=Li>A - B</code> is an expression involving subtraction.</p><p class=Pp><i class=Em>Orphan Sections</i></p><p class=Pp>Orphan sections are sections present in the input files which are not explicitly placed into the output file by the linker script. The linker will still copy these sections into the output file, but it has to guess as to where they should be placed. The linker uses a simple heuristic to do this. It attempts to place orphan sections after non-orphan sections of the same attribute, such as code vs data, loadable vs non-loadable, etc. If there is not enough room to do this then it places at the end of the file.</p><p class=Pp>For ELF targets, the attribute of the section includes section type as well as section flag.</p><p class=Pp><i class=Em>The Location Counter</i></p><p class=Pp>The special linker variable <i class=Em>dot</i> . always contains the current output location counter. Since the . always refers to a location in an output section, it may only appear in an expression within a <code class=Li>SECTIONS</code> command. The . symbol may appear anywhere that an ordinary symbol is allowed in an expression.</p><p class=Pp>Assigning a value to . will cause the location counter to be moved. This may be used to create holes in the output section. The location counter may not be moved backwards inside an output section, and may not be moved backwards outside of an output section if so doing creates areas with overlapping LMAs.</p><div class="Bd Pp Bd-indent"><pre>

{
  output :
    {
      file1(.text)
      . = . + 1000;
      file2(.text)
      . += 1000;
      file3(.text)
    } = 0x12345678;
}
</pre></div> In the previous example, the <code class=Li>.text</code> section from <span class=Pa>file1</span> is located at the beginning of the output section <code class=Li>output</code>. It is followed by a 1000 byte gap. Then the <code class=Li>.text</code> section from <span class=Pa>file2</span> appears, also with a 1000 byte gap following before the <code class=Li>.text</code> section from <span class=Pa>file3</span>. The notation <code class=Li>= 0x12345678</code> specifies what data to write in the gaps (see Section “Output Section Fill”). <p class=Pp>Note: . actually refers to the byte offset from the start of the current containing object. Normally this is the <code class=Li>SECTIONS</code> statement, whose start address is 0, hence . can be used as an absolute address. If . is used inside a section description however, it refers to the byte offset from the start of that section, not an absolute address. Thus in a script like this:</p><div class="Bd Pp Bd-indent"><pre>
SECTIONS
{
    . = 0x100
    .text: {
      *(.text)
      . = 0x200
    }
    . = 0x500
    .data: {
      *(.data)
      . += 0x600
    }
}
</pre></div><p class=Pp>The <code class=Li>.text</code> section will be assigned a starting address of 0x100 and a size of exactly 0x200 bytes, even if there is not enough data in the <code class=Li>.text</code> input sections to fill this area. (If there is too much data, an error will be produced because this would be an attempt to move . backwards). The <code class=Li>.data</code> section will start at 0x500 and it will have an extra 0x600 bytes worth of space after the end of the values from the <code class=Li>.data</code> input sections and before the end of the <code class=Li>.data</code> output section itself.</p><p class=Pp>Setting symbols to the value of the location counter outside of an output section statement can result in unexpected values if the linker needs to place orphan sections. For example, given the following:</p><div class="Bd Pp Bd-indent"><pre>
SECTIONS
{
    start_of_text = . ;
    .text: { *(.text) }
    end_of_text = . ;

    start_of_data = . ;
    .data: { *(.data) }
    end_of_data = . ;
}
</pre></div><p class=Pp>If the linker needs to place some input section, e.g. <code class=Li>.rodata</code>, not mentioned in the script, it might choose to place that section between <code class=Li>.text</code> and <code class=Li>.data</code>. You might think the linker should place <code class=Li>.rodata</code> on the blank line in the above script, but blank lines are of no particular significance to the linker. As well, the linker doesn't associate the above symbol names with their sections. Instead, it assumes that all assignments or other statements belong to the previous output section, except for the special case of an assignment to .. I.e., the linker will place the orphan <code class=Li>.rodata</code> section as if the script was written as follows:</p><div class="Bd Pp Bd-indent"><pre>
SECTIONS
{
    start_of_text = . ;
    .text: { *(.text) }
    end_of_text = . ;

    start_of_data = . ;
    .rodata: { *(.rodata) }
    .data: { *(.data) }
    end_of_data = . ;
}
</pre></div><p class=Pp>This may or may not be the script author's intention for the value of <code class=Li>start_of_data</code>. One way to influence the orphan section placement is to assign the location counter to itself, as the linker assumes that an assignment to . is setting the start address of a following output section and thus should be grouped with that section. So you could write:</p><div class="Bd Pp Bd-indent"><pre>
SECTIONS
{
    start_of_text = . ;
    .text: { *(.text) }
    end_of_text = . ;

    . = . ;
    start_of_data = . ;
    .data: { *(.data) }
    end_of_data = . ;
}
</pre></div><p class=Pp>Now, the orphan <code class=Li>.rodata</code> section will be placed between <code class=Li>end_of_text</code> and <code class=Li>start_of_data</code>.</p><p class=Pp><i class=Em>Operators</i></p><p class=Pp>The linker recognizes the standard C set of arithmetic operators, with the standard bindings and precedence levels:</p><div class="Bd Pp Bd-indent"><pre>

It only computes the value of an expression when absolutely necessary.</p><p class=Pp>The linker needs some information, such as the value of the start address of the first section, and the origins and lengths of memory regions, in order to do any linking at all. These values are computed as soon as possible when the linker reads in the linker script.</p><p class=Pp>However, other values (such as symbol values) are not known or needed until after storage allocation. Such values are evaluated later, when other information (such as the sizes of output sections) is available for use in the symbol assignment expression.</p><p class=Pp>The sizes of sections cannot be known until after allocation, so assignments dependent upon these are not performed until after allocation.</p><p class=Pp>Some expressions, such as those depending upon the location counter ., must be evaluated during section allocation.</p><p class=Pp>If the result of an expression is required, but the value is not available, then an error results. For example, a script like the following</p><div class="Bd Pp Bd-indent"><pre>

</pre></div> will cause the error message <code class=Li>non constant expression for initial address</code>. <p class=Pp><i class=Em>The Section of an Expression</i></p><p class=Pp>When the linker evaluates an expression, the result is either absolute or relative to some section. A relative expression is expressed as a fixed offset from the base of a section.</p><p class=Pp>The position of the expression within the linker script determines whether it is absolute or relative. An expression which appears within an output section definition is relative to the base of the output section. An expression which appears elsewhere will be absolute.</p><p class=Pp>A symbol set to a relative expression will be relocatable if you request relocatable output using the <code class=Li>-r</code> option. That means that a further link operation may change the value of the symbol. The symbol's section will be the section of the relative expression.</p><p class=Pp>A symbol set to an absolute expression will retain the same value through any further link operation. The symbol will be absolute, and will not have any particular associated section.</p><p class=Pp>You can use the builtin function <code class=Li>ABSOLUTE</code> to force an expression to be absolute when it would otherwise be relative. For example, to create an absolute symbol set to the address of the end of the output section <code class=Li>.data</code>:</p><div class="Bd Pp Bd-indent"><pre>

The pointer will in fact point to the function trampoline.</p><p class=Pp>The <code class=Li>--pic-veneer</code> switch makes the linker use PIC sequences for ARM/Thumb interworking veneers, even if the rest of the binary is not PIC.

These stubs only work with code that has been compiled and assembled with the <code class=Li>-mthumb-interwork</code> command line option. If it is necessary to link with old ARM object files or libraries, which have not been compiled with the -mthumb-interwork option then the <code class=Li>--support-old-code</code> command line switch should be given to the linker. This will make it generate larger stub functions which will work with non-interworking aware ARM code. Note, however, the linker does not support generating stubs for function calls to non-interworking aware Thumb code. <p class=Pp>The <code class=Li>--thumb-entry</code> switch is a duplicate of the generic <code class=Li>--entry</code> switch, in that it sets the program's starting address. But it also sets the bottom bit of the address, so that it can be branched to using a BX instruction, and the program will start executing in Thumb mode straight away.</p><p class=Pp>The <code class=Li>--be8</code> switch instructs <a class=Xr href=ld.1.html>ld</a> to generate BE8 format executables. This option is only valid when linking big-endian objects. The resulting image will contain big-endian data and little-endian code.</p><p class=Pp>The <code class=Li>R_ARM_TARGET1</code> relocation is typically used for entries in the <code class=Li>.init_array</code> section. It is interpreted as either <code class=Li>R_ARM_REL32</code> or <code class=Li>R_ARM_ABS32</code>, depending on the target. The <code class=Li>--target1-rel</code> and <code class=Li>--target1-abs</code> switches override the default.</p><p class=Pp>The <code class=Li>--target2=type</code> switch overrides the default definition of the <code class=Li>R_ARM_TARGET2</code> relocation.

Currently it is used to perform calls via the PLT from Thumb code using BLX rather than using BX and a mode-switching stub before each PLT entry. This should lead to such calls executing slightly faster.</p><p class=Pp>This option is enabled implicitly for SymbianOS, so there is no need to specify it if you are using that target.</p><p class=Pp>The <code class=Li>--vfp11-denorm-fix</code> switch enables a link-time workaround for a bug in certain VFP11 coprocessor hardware, which sometimes allows instructions with denorm operands (which must be handled by support code) to have those operands overwritten by subsequent instructions before the support code can read the intended values.</p><p class=Pp>The bug may be avoided in scalar mode if you allow at least one intervening instruction between a VFP11 instruction which uses a register and another instruction which writes to the same register, or at least two intervening instructions if vector mode is in use. The bug only affects full-compliance floating-point mode: you do not need this workaround if you are using "runfast" mode. Please contact ARM for further details.</p><p class=Pp>If you know you are using buggy VFP11 hardware, you can enable this workaround by specifying the linker option <code class=Li>--vfp-denorm-fix=scalar</code> if you are using the VFP11 scalar mode only, or <code class=Li>--vfp-denorm-fix=vector</code> if you are using vector mode (the latter also works for scalar code). The default is <code class=Li>--vfp-denorm-fix=none</code>.</p><p class=Pp>If the workaround is enabled, instructions are scanned for potentially-troublesome sequences, and a veneer is created for each such sequence which may trigger the erratum. The veneer consists of the first instruction of the sequence and a branch back to the subsequent instruction. The original instruction is then replaced with a branch to the veneer. The extra cycles required to call and return from the veneer are sufficient to avoid the erratum in both the scalar and vector cases.</p><p class=Pp>The <code class=Li>--no-enum-size-warning</code> switch prevents the linker from warning when linking object files that specify incompatible EABI enumeration size attributes. For example, with this switch enabled, linking of an object file using 32-bit enumeration values with another using enumeration values fitted into the smallest possible space will not be diagnosed.</p></section><section class=Ss><h2 class=Ss><a class=Xr href=ld.and.html>ld(and)</a> HPPA 32-bit ELF Support</h2> When generating a shared library, <a class=Xr href=ld.1.html>ld</a> will by default generate import stubs suitable for use with a single sub-space application. The <code class=Li>--multi-subspace</code> switch causes <a class=Xr href=ld.1.html>ld</a> to generate export stubs, and different (larger) import stubs suitable for use with multiple sub-spaces. <p class=Pp>Long branch stubs and import/export stubs are placed by <a class=Xr href=ld.1.html>ld</a> in stub sections located between groups of input sections. <code class=Li>--stub-group-size</code> specifies the maximum size of a group of input sections handled by one stub section. Since branch offsets are signed, a stub section may serve two groups of input sections, one group before the stub section, and one group after it. However, when using conditional branches that require stubs, it may be better (for branch prediction) that stub sections only serve one group of input sections. A negative value for <code class=Li>N</code> chooses this scheme, ensuring that branches to stubs always use a negative offset. Two special values of <code class=Li>N</code> are recognized, <code class=Li>1</code> and <code class=Li>-1</code>. These both instruct <a class=Xr href=ld.1.html>ld</a> to automatically size input section groups for the branch types detected, with the same behaviour regarding stub placement as other positive or negative values of <code class=Li>N</code> respectively.</p><p class=Pp>Note that <code class=Li>--stub-group-size</code> does not split input sections.

The simulator <code class=Li>mmix</code> understands the <code class=Li>mmo</code> format. The binutils <code class=Li>objcopy</code> utility can translate between the two formats. <p class=Pp>There is one special section, the <code class=Li>.MMIX.reg_contents</code> section. Contents in this section is assumed to correspond to that of global registers, and symbols referring to it are translated to special symbols, equal to registers. In a final link, the start address of the <code class=Li>.MMIX.reg_contents</code> section corresponds to the first allocated global register multiplied by 8.

This increases the effort necessary to port existing Un*x code to these platforms, especially for large c++ libraries and applications. The auto-import feature, which was initially provided by Paul Sokolovsky, allows one to omit the decorations to achieve a behavior that conforms to that on POSIX/Un*x platforms. This feature is enabled with the <code class=Li>--enable-auto-import</code> command-line option, although it is enabled by default on cygwin/mingw. The <code class=Li>--enable-auto-import</code> option itself now serves mainly to suppress any warnings that are ordinarily emitted when linked objects trigger the feature's use. <p class=Pp>auto-import of variables does not always work flawlessly without additional assistance.

One of these methods is the <i class=Em>runtime pseudo-relocs</i> feature, described below.</p><p class=Pp>For complex variables imported from DLLs (such as structs or classes), object files typically contain a base address for the variable and an offset ( <i class=Em>addend</i>) within the variable--to specify a particular field or public member, for instance.

The standard auto-import feature described above is unable to resolve these references.</p><p class=Pp>The <code class=Li>--enable-runtime-pseudo-relocs</code> switch allows these references to be resolved without error, while leaving the task of adjusting the references themselves (with their non-zero addends) to specialized code provided by the runtime environment.

This is much faster and uses much less memory than does the traditional import library method, especially when linking large libraries or applications. When <a class=Xr href=ld.1.html>ld</a> creates an import lib, each function or variable exported from the dll is stored in its own bfd, even though a single bfd could contain many exports. The overhead involved in storing, loading, and processing so many bfd's is quite large, and explains the tremendous time, memory, and storage needed to link against particularly large or complex libraries when using import libs. <p class=Pp>Linking directly to a dll uses no extra command-line switches other than <code class=Li>-L</code> and <code class=Li>-l</code>, because <a class=Xr href=ld.1.html>ld</a> already searches for a number of names to match each library. All that is needed from the developer's perspective is an understanding of this search, in order to force ld to select the dll instead of an import library.</p><p class=Pp>For instance, when ld is called with the argument <code class=Li>-lxxx</code> it will attempt to find, in the first directory of its search path,</p><div class="Bd Pp Bd-indent"><pre>

But the ability to replace true import libs with a simple symbolic link to (or a copy of) a dll, in many cases, is a useful addition to the suite of tools binutils makes available to the win32 developer.

A valid interleaving might place the <code class=Li>.literal</code> sections from an initial group of files followed by the <code class=Li>.text</code> sections of that group of files. Then, the <code class=Li>.literal</code> sections from the rest of the files and the <code class=Li>.text</code> sections from the rest of the files would follow.</p><p class=Pp>Relaxation is enabled by default for the Xtensa version of <a class=Xr href=ld.1.html>ld</a> and provides two important link-time optimizations. The first optimization is to combine identical literal values to reduce code size. A redundant literal will be removed and all the <code class=Li>L32R</code> instructions that use it will be changed to reference an identical literal, as long as the location of the replacement literal is within the offset range of all the <code class=Li>L32R</code> instructions. The second optimization is to remove unnecessary overhead from assembler-generated “longcall” sequences of <code class=Li>L32R</code> / <code class=Li>CALLX</code><var class=Va>n</var> when the target functions are within range of direct <code class=Li>CALL</code><var class=Va>n</var> instructions.</p><p class=Pp>For each of these cases where an indirect call sequence can be optimized to a direct call, the linker will change the <code class=Li>CALLX</code><var class=Va>n</var> instruction to a <code class=Li>CALL</code><var class=Va>n</var> instruction, remove the <code class=Li>L32R</code> instruction, and remove the literal referenced by the <code class=Li>L32R</code> instruction if it is not used for anything else. Removing the <code class=Li>L32R</code> instruction always reduces code size but can potentially hurt performance by changing the alignment of subsequent branch targets. By default, the linker will always preserve alignments, either by switching some instructions between 24-bit encodings and the equivalent density instructions or by inserting a no-op in place of the <code class=Li>L32R</code> instruction that was removed. If code size is more important than performance, the [--size-opt] option can be used to prevent the linker from widening density instructions or inserting no-ops, except in a few cases where no-ops are required for correctness.</p><p class=Pp>The following Xtensa-specific command-line options can be used to control the linker:</p><dl class=Bl-tag><dt>--no-relax</dt><dd>Since the Xtensa version of <code class=Li>ld</code> enables the [--relax] option by default, the [--no-relax] option is provided to disable relaxation.</dd><dt>--size-opt</dt><dd>When optimizing indirect calls to direct calls, optimize for code size more than performance.

These libraries allow the linker to use the same routines to operate on object files whatever the object file format. A different object file format can be supported simply by creating a new BFD back end and adding it to the library. To conserve runtime memory, however, the linker and associated tools are usually configured to support only a subset of the object file formats available. You can use <code class=Li>objdump -i</code> (see Section “objdump”) to list all the formats available for your configuration. <p class=Pp>As with most implementations, BFD is a compromise between several conflicting requirements. The major factor influencing BFD design was efficiency: any time used converting between formats is time which would not have been spent had BFD not been involved. This is partly offset by abstraction payback; since BFD simplifies applications and back ends, more time and care may be spent optimizing algorithms for a greater speed.</p><p class=Pp>One minor artifact of the BFD solution which you should bear in mind is the potential for information loss. There are two places where useful information can be lost using the BFD mechanism: during conversion and during output.See Section “BFD information loss”.</p><section class=Ss><h2 class=Ss>How It Works: <span class=An>Outline of BFD</span></h2> When an object file is opened, BFD subroutines automatically determine the format of the input object file. They then build a descriptor in memory with pointers to routines that will be used to access elements of the object file's data structures. <p class=Pp>As different information from the object files is required, BFD reads from different sections of the file and processes them. For example, a very common operation for the linker is processing symbol tables. Each BFD back end provides a routine for converting between the object file's representation of symbols and an internal canonical format. When the linker asks for the symbol table of an object file, it calls through a memory pointer to the routine from the relevant BFD back end which reads and converts the table into a canonical form. The linker then operates upon the canonical form. When the link is finished and the linker writes the output file's symbol table, another BFD back end routine is called to take the newly created symbol table and convert it into the chosen output format.</p><p class=Pp><i class=Em>Information Loss</i></p><p class=Pp><i class=Em>Information can be lost during output.</i> The output formats supported by BFD do not provide identical facilities, and information which can be described in one form has nowhere to go in another format. One example of this is alignment information in <code class=Li>b.out</code>. There is nowhere in an <code class=Li>a.out</code> format file to store alignment information on the contained data, so when a file is linked from <code class=Li>b.out</code> and an <code class=Li>a.out</code> image is produced, alignment information will not propagate to the output file. (The linker will still use the alignment information internally, so the link is performed correctly).</p><p class=Pp>Another example is COFF section names. COFF files may contain an unlimited number of sections, each one with a textual section name. If the target of the link is a format which does not have many sections (e.g., <code class=Li>a.out</code>) or has sections without names (e.g., the Oasys format), the link cannot be done simply. You can circumvent this problem by describing the desired input-to-output section mapping with the linker command language.</p><p class=Pp><i class=Em>Information can be lost during canonicalization.</i> The BFD internal canonical form of the external formats is not exhaustive; there are structures in input formats for which there is no direct representation internally. This means that the BFD back ends cannot maintain all possible data richness through the transformation between external to internal and back to external formats.</p><p class=Pp>This limitation is only a problem when an application reads one format and writes another. Each BFD back end is responsible for maintaining as much data as possible, and the internal BFD canonical form has structures which are opaque to the BFD core, and exported only to the back ends. When a file is read in one format, the canonical form is generated for BFD and the application. At the same time, the back end saves away any information which may otherwise be lost. If the data is then written back in the same format, the back end routine will be able to use the canonical form provided by the BFD core as well as the information it prepared earlier. Since there is a great deal of commonality between back ends, there is no information lost when linking or copying big endian COFF to little endian COFF, or <code class=Li>a.out</code> to <code class=Li>b.out</code>. When a mixture of formats is linked, the information is only lost from the files whose format differs from the destination.</p><p class=Pp><i class=Em>The BFD canonical object-file format</i></p><p class=Pp>The greatest potential for loss of information occurs when there is the least overlap between the information provided by the source format, that stored by the canonical format, and that needed by the destination format. A brief description of the canonical form may help you understand which kinds of data you can count on preserving across conversions.</p><dl class=Bl-tag><dt>files</dt><dd>Information stored on a per-file basis includes target machine architecture, particular implementation format type, a demand pageable bit, and a write protected bit. Information like Unix magic numbers is not stored here---only the magic numbers' meaning, so a <code class=Li>ZMAGIC</code> file would have both the demand pageable bit and the write protected text bit set. The byte order of the target is stored on a per-file basis, so that big- and little-endian object files may be used with one another.</dd><dt>sections</dt><dd>Each section in the input file contains the name of the section, the section's original address in the object file, size and alignment information, various flags, and pointers into other BFD data structures.</dd><dt>symbols</dt><dd>Each symbol contains a pointer to the information for the object file which originally defined it, its name, its value, and various flag bits. When a BFD back end reads in a symbol table, it relocates all symbols to make them relative to the base of the section where they were defined. Doing this ensures that each symbol points to its containing section. Each symbol also has a varying amount of hidden private data for the BFD back end. Since the symbol points to the original file, the private data format for that symbol is accessible. <code class=Li>ld</code> can operate on a collection of symbols of wildly different formats without problems. <p class=Pp>Normal global and simple local symbols are maintained on output, so an output file (no matter its format) will retain symbols pointing to functions and to global, static, and common variables. Some symbol information is not worth retaining; in <code class=Li>a.out</code>, type information is stored in the symbol table as long symbol names. This information would be useless to most COFF debuggers; the linker has command line switches to allow users to throw it away.</p><p class=Pp>There is one word of type information within the symbol, so if the format supports symbol type information within symbols (for example, COFF, IEEE, Oasys) and the type is simple enough to fit within one word (nearly everything but aggregates), the information will be preserved.</p></dd><dt>relocation level</dt><dd>Each canonical BFD relocation record contains a pointer to the symbol to relocate to, the offset of the data to relocate, the section the data is in, and a pointer to a relocation type descriptor. Relocation is performed by passing messages through the relocation type descriptor and the symbol pointer. Therefore, relocations can be performed on output data using a relocation method that is only available in one of the input formats. For instance, Oasys provides a byte relocation format. A relocation record requesting this relocation type would point indirectly to a routine to perform this, so the relocation may be performed on a byte being written to a 68k COFF file, even though 68k COFF has no such relocation type.</dd><dt>line numbers</dt><dd>Object formats can contain, for debugging purposes, some form of mapping between symbols, source line numbers, and addresses in the output file. These addresses have to be relocated along with the symbol information. Each symbol with an associated list of line number records points to the first record of the list. The head of a line number list consists of a pointer to the symbol, which allows finding out the address of the function whose line number is being described. The rest of the list is made up of pairs: offsets into the section and line numbers. Any format which can simply derive this information can pass it successfully between formats (COFF, IEEE and Oasys).</dd></dl></section></section><section class=Sh><h2 class=Sh id=Reporting_Bugs><a class=permalink href=#Reporting_Bugs>Reporting Bugs</a></h2> Your bug reports play an essential role in making <a class=Xr href=ld.1.html>ld</a> reliable. <p class=Pp>Reporting a bug may help you by bringing a solution to your problem, or it may not.

You might as well expedite matters by sending them to begin with.</p><p class=Pp>To enable us to fix the bug, you should include all these things:</p><ul class=Bl-bullet><li>The version of <a class=Xr href=ld.1.html>ld</a>. <a class=Xr href=ld.1.html>ld</a> announces it if you start it with the <code class=Li>--version</code> argument. <p class=Pp>Without this, we will not know whether there is any point in looking for the bug in the current version of <a class=Xr href=ld.1.html>ld</a>.</p></li><li>Any patches you may have applied to the <a class=Xr href=ld.1.html>ld</a> source, including any patches made to the <code class=Li>BFD</code> library.</li><li>The type of machine you are using, and the operating system name and version number.</li><li>What compiler (and its version) was used to compile <a class=Xr href=ld.1.html>ld</a> ---e.g. “ <code class=Li>gcc-2.7</code> ”.</li><li>The command arguments you gave the linker to link your example and observe the bug. To guarantee you will not omit something important, list them all. A copy of the Makefile (or the output from make) is sufficient. <p class=Pp>If we were to try to guess the arguments, we would probably guess wrong and then we might not encounter the bug.</p></li><li>A complete input file, or set of input files, that will reproduce the bug. It is generally most helpful to send the actual object files provided that they are reasonably small. Say no more than 10K. For bigger files you can either make them available by FTP or HTTP or else state that you are willing to send the object file(s) to whomever requests them. (Note - your email will be going to a mailing list, so we do not want to clog it up with large attachments). But small attachments are best. <p class=Pp>If the source files were assembled using <code class=Li>gas</code> or compiled using <code class=Li>gcc</code>, then it may be OK to send the source files rather than the object files. In this case, be sure to say exactly what version of <code class=Li>gas</code> or <code class=Li>gcc</code> was used to produce the object files. Also say how <code class=Li>gas</code> or <code class=Li>gcc</code> were configured.</p></li><li>A description of what behavior you observe that you believe is incorrect. For example, “It gets a fatal signal.” <p class=Pp>Of course, if the bug is that <a class=Xr href=ld.1.html>ld</a> gets a fatal signal, then we will certainly notice it. But if the bug is incorrect output, we might not notice unless it is glaringly wrong. You might as well not give us a chance to make a mistake.</p><p class=Pp>Even if the problem you experience is a fatal signal, you should still say so explicitly. Suppose something strange is going on, such as, your copy of <a class=Xr href=ld.1.html>ld</a> is out of sync, or you have encountered a bug in the C library on your system. (This has happened!) Your copy might crash and ours would not. If you told us to expect a crash, then when ours fails to crash, we would know that the bug was not happening for us. If you had not told us to expect a crash, then we would not be able to draw any conclusion from our observations.</p></li><li>If you wish to suggest changes to the <a class=Xr href=ld.1.html>ld</a> source, send us context diffs, as generated by <code class=Li>diff</code> with the <code class=Li>-u</code>, <code class=Li>-c</code>, or <code class=Li>-p</code> option. Always send diffs from the old file to the new file. If you even discuss something in the <a class=Xr href=ld.1.html>ld</a> source, refer to it by context, not by line number. <p class=Pp>The line numbers in our development sources will not match those in your sources. Your line numbers would convey no useful information to us.</p></li></ul><p class=Pp>Here are some things that are not necessary:</p><ul class=Bl-bullet><li>A description of the envelope of the bug. <p class=Pp>Often people who encounter a bug spend a lot of time investigating which changes to the input file will make the bug go away and which changes will not affect it.</p><p class=Pp>This is often time consuming and not very useful, because the way we will find the bug is by running a single example under the debugger with breakpoints, not by pure deduction from a series of examples. We recommend that you save your time for something else.</p><p class=Pp>Of course, if you can find a simpler example to report <i class=Em>instead</i> of the original one, that is a convenience for us. Errors in the output will be easier to spot, running under the debugger will take less time, and so on.</p><p class=Pp>However, simplification is not vital; if you do not want to do this, report the bug anyway and send us the entire test case you used.</p></li><li>A patch for the bug. <p class=Pp>A patch for the bug does help us if it is a good one. But do not omit the necessary information, such as the test case, on the assumption that a patch is all we need. We might see problems with your patch and decide to fix the problem another way, or we might not understand it at all.</p><p class=Pp>Sometimes with a program as complicated as <a class=Xr href=ld.1.html>ld</a> it is very hard to construct an example that will make the program follow a certain path through the code. If you do not send us the example, we will not be able to construct one, so we will not be able to verify that the bug is fixed.</p><p class=Pp>And if we cannot understand what bug you are trying to fix, or why your patch should be an improvement, we will not install it. A test case will help us to understand.</p></li><li>A guess about what the bug is or what it depends on. <p class=Pp>Such guesses are usually wrong. Even we cannot guess right about such things without first using the debugger to find the facts.</p></li></ul></section></section><section class=Sh><h2 class=Sh id=MRI_Compatible_Script_Files><a class=permalink href=#MRI_Compatible_Script_Files>MRI Compatible Script Files</a></h2> To aid users making the transition to GNU <a class=Xr href=ld.1.html>ld</a> from the MRI linker, <a class=Xr href=ld.1.html>ld</a> can use MRI compatible linker scripts as an alternative to the more general-purpose linker scripting language described in Scripts. MRI compatible linker scripts have a much simpler command set than the scripting language otherwise used with <a class=Xr href=ld.1.html>ld</a>. GNU <a class=Xr href=ld.1.html>ld</a> supports the most commonly used MRI linker commands; these commands are described here. <p class=Pp>In general, MRI scripts aren't of much use with the <code class=Li>a.out</code> object file format, since it only has three sections and MRI scripts lack some features to make use of them.</p><p class=Pp>You can specify a file containing an MRI-compatible script using the <code class=Li>-c</code> command-line option.</p><p class=Pp>Each command in an MRI-compatible script occupies its own line; each command line starts with the keyword that identifies the command (though blank lines are also allowed for punctuation). If a line of an MRI-compatible script begins with an unrecognized keyword, <a class=Xr href=ld.1.html>ld</a> issues a warning message, but continues processing the script.</p><p class=Pp>Lines beginning with <code class=Li>*</code> are comments.</p><p class=Pp>You can write these commands using all upper-case letters, or all lower case; for example, <code class=Li>chip</code> is the same as <code class=Li>CHIP</code>. The following list shows only the upper-case form of each command.</p><dl class=Bl-tag><dt>ABSOLUTE <var class=Va>secname</var></dt><dd style="width: auto;"> </dd><dt>ABSOLUTE <var class=Va>secname,</var><var class=Va>secname, ...</var><var class=Va>secname</var></dt><dd>Normally, <a class=Xr href=ld.1.html>ld</a> includes in the output file all sections from all the input files. However, in an MRI-compatible script, you can use the <code class=Li>ABSOLUTE</code> command to restrict the sections that will be present in your output program. If the <code class=Li>ABSOLUTE</code> command is used at all in a script, then only the sections named explicitly in <code class=Li>ABSOLUTE</code> commands will appear in the linker output.

Secondarily, this License preserves for the author and publisher a way to get credit for their work, while not being considered responsible for modifications made by others.</p><p class=Pp>This License is a kind of “copyleft”, which means that derivative works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense. It complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft license designed for free software.</p><p class=Pp>We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free software, because free software needs free documentation: a free program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the software does. But this License is not limited to software manuals; it can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or whether it is published as a printed book. We recommend this License principally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference.</p></li><li>APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS <p class=Pp>This License applies to any manual or other work that contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be distributed under the terms of this License. The “Document”, below, refers to any such manual or work. Any member of the public is a licensee, and is addressed as “you.”</p><p class=Pp>A “Modified Version” of the Document means any work containing the Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with modifications and/or translated into another language.</p><p class=Pp>A “Secondary Section” is a named appendix or a front-matter section of the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall directly within that overall subject. (For example, if the Document is in part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain any mathematics.) The relationship could be a matter of historical connection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal, commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding them.</p><p class=Pp>The “Invariant Sections” are certain Secondary Sections whose titles are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice that says that the Document is released under this License.</p><p class=Pp>The “Cover Texts” are certain short passages of text that are listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that the Document is released under this License.</p><p class=Pp>A “Transparent” copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy, represented in a format whose specification is available to the general public, whose contents can be viewed and edited directly and straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input to text formatters. A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file format whose markup has been designed to thwart or discourage subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent. A copy that is not “Transparent” is called “Opaque.”</p><p class=Pp>Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML or XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple HTML designed for human modification. Opaque formats include PostScript, PDF, proprietary formats that can be read and edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally available, and the machine-generated HTML produced by some word processors for output purposes only.</p><p class=Pp>The “Title Page” means, for a printed book, the title page itself, plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material this License requires to appear in the title page. For works in formats which do not have any title page as such, “Title Page” means the text near the most prominent appearance of the work's title, preceding the beginning of the body of the text.</p></li><li>VERBATIM COPYING <p class=Pp>You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no other conditions whatsoever to those of this License. You may not use technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further copying of the copies you make or distribute. However, you may accept compensation in exchange for copies. If you distribute a large enough number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3.</p><p class=Pp>You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and you may publicly display copies.</p></li><li>COPYING IN QUANTITY <p class=Pp>If you publish printed copies of the Document numbering more than 100, and the Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on the back cover. Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify you as the publisher of these copies. The front cover must present the full title with all words of the title equally prominent and visible. You may add other material on the covers in addition. Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve the title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in other respects.</p><p class=Pp>If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent pages.</p><p class=Pp>If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy a publicly-accessible computer-network location containing a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material, which the general network-using public has access to download anonymously at no charge using public-standard network protocols. If you use the latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated location until at least one year after the last time you distribute an Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that edition to the public.</p><p class=Pp>It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the Document.</p></li><li>MODIFICATIONS <p class=Pp>You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution and modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy of it. In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version:</p><p class=Pp>A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct from that of the Document, and from those of previous versions (which should, if there were any, be listed in the History section of the Document). You may use the same title as a previous version if the original publisher of that version gives permission. B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified Version, together with at least five of the principal authors of the Document (all of its principal authors, if it has less than five). C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the Modified Version, as the publisher. D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document. E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications adjacent to the other copyright notices. F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice giving the public permission to use the Modified Version under the terms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below. G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections and required Cover Texts given in the Document's license notice. H. Include an unaltered copy of this License. I. Preserve the section entitled “History”, and its title, and add to it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title Page. If there is no section entitled “History” in the Document, create one stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as given on its Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified Version as stated in the previous sentence. J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise the network locations given in the Document for previous versions it was based on. These may be placed in the “History” section. You may omit a network location for a work that was published at least four years before the Document itself, or if the original publisher of the version it refers to gives permission. K. In any section entitled “Acknowledgements” or “Dedications”, preserve the section's title, and preserve in the section all the substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements and/or dedications given therein. L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document, unaltered in their text and in their titles. Section numbers or the equivalent are not considered part of the section titles. M. Delete any section entitled “Endorsements.” Such a section may not be included in the Modified Version. N. Do not retitle any existing section as “Endorsements” or to conflict in title with any Invariant Section.</p><p class=Pp>If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material copied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or all of these sections as invariant. To do this, add their titles to the list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version's license notice. These titles must be distinct from any other section titles.</p><p class=Pp>You may add a section entitled “Endorsements”, provided it contains nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various parties--for example, statements of peer review or that the text has been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a standard.</p><p class=Pp>You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list of Cover Texts in the Modified Version. Only one passage of Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or through arrangements made by) any one entity. If the Document already includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of, you may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit permission from the previous publisher that added the old one.</p><p class=Pp>The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License give permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or imply endorsement of any Modified Version.</p></li><li>COMBINING DOCUMENTS <p class=Pp>You may combine the Document with other documents released under this License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified versions, provided that you include in the combination all of the Invariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and list them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its license notice.</p><p class=Pp>The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single copy. If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but different contents, make the title of each such section unique by adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original author or publisher of that section if known, or else a unique number. Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work.</p><p class=Pp>In the combination, you must combine any sections entitled “History” in the various original documents, forming one section entitled “History”; likewise combine any sections entitled “Acknowledgements”, and any sections entitled “Dedications.” You must delete all sections entitled “Endorsements.”</p></li><li>COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS <p class=Pp>You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents released under this License, and replace the individual copies of this License in the various documents with a single copy that is included in the collection, provided that you follow the rules of this License for verbatim copying of each of the documents in all other respects.</p><p class=Pp>You may extract a single document from such a collection, and distribute it individually under this License, provided you insert a copy of this License into the extracted document, and follow this License in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of that document.</p></li><li>AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS <p class=Pp>A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, does not as a whole count as a Modified Version of the Document, provided no compilation copyright is claimed for the compilation. Such a compilation is called an “aggregate”, and this License does not apply to the other self-contained works thus compiled with the Document, on account of their being thus compiled, if they are not themselves derivative works of the Document.</p><p class=Pp>If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one quarter of the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed on covers that surround only the Document within the aggregate. Otherwise they must appear on covers around the whole aggregate.</p></li><li>TRANSLATION <p class=Pp>Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section 4. Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special permission from their copyright holders, but you may include translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the original versions of these Invariant Sections. You may include a translation of this License provided that you also include the original English version of this License. In case of a disagreement between the translation and the original English version of this License, the original English version will prevail.</p></li><li>TERMINATION <p class=Pp>You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document except as expressly provided for under this License. Any other attempt to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Document is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.</p></li><li>FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE <p class=Pp>The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns. See http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/.</p><p class=Pp>Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number.
