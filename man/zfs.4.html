The scheduler determines when and in what order those operations are issued. The scheduler divides operations into five I/O classes, prioritized in the following order: sync read, sync write, async read, async write, and scrub/resilver. Each queue defines the minimum and maximum number of concurrent operations that may be issued to the device. In addition, the device has an aggregate maximum, <b class=Sy>zfs_vdev_max_active</b>. Note that the sum of the per-queue minima must not exceed the aggregate maximum. If the sum of the per-queue maxima exceeds the aggregate maximum, then the number of active operations may reach <b class=Sy>zfs_vdev_max_active</b>, in which case no further operations will be issued, regardless of whether all per-queue minima have been met. <p class=Pp>For many physical devices, throughput increases with the number of concurrent operations, but latency typically suffers. Furthermore, physical devices typically have a limit at which more concurrent operations have no effect on throughput or can actually cause it to decrease.</p><p class=Pp>The scheduler selects the next operation to issue by first looking for an I/O class whose minimum has not been satisfied. Once all are satisfied and the aggregate maximum has not been hit, the scheduler looks for classes whose maximum has not been satisfied. Iteration through the I/O classes is done in the order specified above. No further operations are issued if the aggregate maximum number of concurrent operations has been hit, or if there are no operations queued for an I/O class that has not hit its maximum. Every time an I/O operation is queued or an operation completes, the scheduler looks for new operations to issue.</p><p class=Pp>In general, smaller <b class=Sy>max_active</b>s will lead to lower latency of synchronous operations. Larger <b class=Sy>max_active</b>s may lead to higher overall throughput, depending on underlying storage.</p><p class=Pp>The ratio of the queues' <b class=Sy>max_active</b>s determines the balance of performance between reads, writes, and scrubs. For example, increasing <b class=Sy>zfs_vdev_scrub_max_active</b> will cause the scrub or resilver to complete more quickly, but reads and writes to have higher latency and lower throughput.</p><p class=Pp>All I/O classes have a fixed maximum number of outstanding operations, except for the async write class. Asynchronous writes represent the data that is committed to stable storage during the syncing stage for transaction groups. Transaction groups enter the syncing state periodically, so the number of queued async writes will quickly burst up and then bleed down to zero. Rather than servicing them as quickly as possible, the I/O scheduler changes the maximum number of active async write operations according to the amount of dirty data in the pool. Since both throughput and latency typically increase with the number of concurrent operations issued to physical devices, reducing the burstiness in the number of concurrent operations also stabilizes the response time of operations from other – and in particular synchronous – queues. In broad strokes, the I/O scheduler will issue more concurrent operations from the async write queue as there's more dirty data in the pool.</p><section class=Ss><h2 class=Ss id=Async_Writes><a class=permalink href=#Async_Writes>Async Writes</a></h2> The number of concurrent operations issued for the async write I/O class follows a piece-wise linear function defined by a few adjustable points: <div class="Bd Pp"><pre>
