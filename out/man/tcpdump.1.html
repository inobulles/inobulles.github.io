packets on a network interface that match the boolean <i>expression</i>; the description is preceded by a time stamp, printed, by default, as hours, minutes, seconds, and fractions of a second since midnight. It can also be run with the <b>-w</b> flag, which causes it to save the packet data to a file for later analysis, and/or with the <b>-r</b> flag, which causes it to read from a saved packet file rather than to read packets from a network interface. It can also be run with the <b>-V</b> flag, which causes it to read a list of saved packet files. In all cases, only packets that match <i>expression</i> will be processed by <i>tcpdump</i>. <p class=Pp><i>Tcpdump</i> will, if not run with the <b>-c</b> flag, continue capturing packets until it is interrupted by a SIGINT signal (generated, for example, by typing your interrupt character, typically control-C) or a SIGTERM signal (typically generated with the <b>kill</b>(1) command); if run with the <b>-c</b> flag, it will capture packets until it is interrupted by a SIGINT or SIGTERM signal or the specified number of packets have been processed.</p><p class=Pp>When <i>tcpdump</i> finishes capturing packets, it will report counts of:</p><dl class=Bl-tag><dt></dt><dd>packets ``captured'' (this is the number of packets that <i>tcpdump</i> has received and processed);</dd><dt></dt><dd>packets ``received by filter'' (the meaning of this depends on the OS on which you're running <i>tcpdump</i>, and possibly on the way the OS was configured - if a filter was specified on the command line, on some OSes it counts packets regardless of whether they were matched by the filter expression and, even if they were matched by the filter expression, regardless of whether <i>tcpdump</i> has read and processed them yet, on other OSes it counts only packets that were matched by the filter expression regardless of whether <i>tcpdump</i> has read and processed them yet, and on other OSes it counts only packets that were matched by the filter expression and were processed by <i>tcpdump</i>);</dd><dt></dt><dd>packets ``dropped by kernel'' (this is the number of packets that were dropped, due to a lack of buffer space, by the packet capture mechanism in the OS on which <i>tcpdump</i> is running, if the OS reports that information to applications; if not, it will be reported as 0).</dd></dl><p class=Pp>On platforms that support the SIGINFO signal, such as most BSDs (including Mac OS X) and Digital/Tru64 UNIX, it will report those counts when it receives a SIGINFO signal (generated, for example, by typing your ``status'' character, typically control-T, although on some platforms, such as Mac OS X, the ``status'' character is not set by default, so you must set it with <b>stty</b>(1) in order to use it) and will continue capturing packets.

</pre></div> The first line says that TCP port 1023 on rtsg sent a packet to port <i>login</i> on csam. The <b>S</b> indicates that the <i>SYN</i> flag was set. The packet sequence number was 768512 and it contained no data. (The notation is `first:last' which means `sequence numbers <i>first</i> up to but not including <i>last</i>.) There was no piggy-backed ack, the available receive window was 4096 bytes and there was a max-segment-size option requesting an mss of 1024 bytes. <p class=Pp>Csam replies with a similar packet except it includes a piggy-backed ack for rtsg's SYN. Rtsg then acks csam's SYN. The `.' means the ACK flag was set. The packet contained no data so there is no data sequence number or length. Note that the ack sequence number is a small integer (1). The first time <i>tcpdump</i> sees a TCP `conversation', it prints the sequence number from the packet. On subsequent packets of the conversation, the difference between the current packet's sequence number and this initial sequence number is printed. This means that sequence numbers after the first can be interpreted as relative byte positions in the conversation's data stream (with the first data byte each direction being `1'). `-S' will override this feature, causing the original sequence numbers to be output.</p><p class=Pp>On the 6th line, rtsg sends csam 19 bytes of data (bytes 2 through 20 in the rtsg → csam side of the conversation). The PUSH flag is set in the packet. On the 7th line, csam says it's received data sent by rtsg up to but not including byte 21. Most of this data is apparently sitting in the socket buffer since csam's receive window has gotten 19 bytes smaller. Csam also sends one byte of data to rtsg in this packet. On the 8th and 9th lines, csam sends two bytes of urgent, pushed data to rtsg.</p><p class=Pp>If the snapshot was small enough that <i>tcpdump</i> didn't capture the full TCP header, it interprets as much of the header as it can and then reports ``[|<i>tcp</i>]'' to indicate the remainder could not be interpreted. If the header contains a bogus option (one with a length that's either too small or beyond the end of the header), <i>tcpdump</i> reports it as ``[<i>bad opt</i>]'' and does not interpret any further options (since it's impossible to tell where they start). If the header length indicates options are present but the IP datagram length is not long enough for the options to actually be there, <i>tcpdump</i> reports it as ``[<i>bad hdr length</i>]''.</p><p class=Pp><b><b>Capturing TCP packets with particular flag combinations (SYN-ACK, URG-ACK, etc.)</b></b></p><p class=Pp>There are 8 bits in the control bits section of the TCP header:</p><dl class=Bl-tag><dt></dt><dd><i>CWR | ECE | URG | ACK | PSH | RST | SYN | FIN</i></dd></dl><p class=Pp>Let's assume that we want to watch packets used in establishing a TCP connection.

<span class=Li>pike.afsfs &gt; elvis.7001: rx data fs reply rename</span>
<span class=Li></span>

</pre></div> In the first line, host elvis sends a RX packet to pike. This was a RX data packet to the fs (fileserver) service, and is the start of an RPC call. The RPC call was a rename, with the old directory file id of 536876964/1/1 and an old filename of `.newsrc.new', and a new directory file id of 536876964/1/1 and a new filename of `.newsrc'. The host pike responds with a RPC reply to the rename call (which was successful, because it was a data packet and not an abort packet). <p class=Pp>In general, all AFS RPCs are decoded at least by RPC call name. Most AFS RPCs have at least some of the arguments decoded (generally only the `interesting' arguments, for some definition of interesting).</p><p class=Pp>The format is intended to be self-describing, but it will probably not be useful to people who are not familiar with the workings of AFS and RX.</p><p class=Pp>If the -v (verbose) flag is given twice, acknowledgement packets and additional header information is printed, such as the RX call ID, call number, sequence number, serial number, and the RX packet flags.</p><p class=Pp>If the -v flag is given twice, additional information is printed, such as the RX call ID, serial number, and the RX packet flags. The MTU negotiation information is also printed from RX ack packets.</p><p class=Pp>If the -v flag is given three times, the security index and service id are printed.</p><p class=Pp>Error codes are printed for abort packets, with the exception of Ubik beacon packets (because abort packets are used to signify a yes vote for the Ubik protocol).</p><p class=Pp>Note that AFS requests are very large and many of the arguments won't be printed unless <i>snaplen</i> is increased. Try using `<b>-s 256</b>' to watch AFS traffic.</p><p class=Pp>AFS reply packets do not explicitly identify the RPC operation. Instead, <i>tcpdump</i> keeps track of ``recent'' requests, and matches them to the replies using the call number and service ID. If a reply does not closely follow the corresponding request, it might not be parsable.</p><p class=Pp></p><p class=Pp><b>KIP AppleTalk (DDP in UDP)</b></p><p class=Pp>AppleTalk DDP packets encapsulated in UDP datagrams are de-encapsulated and dumped as DDP packets (i.e., all the UDP header information is discarded). The file <i>/etc/atalk.names</i> is used to translate AppleTalk net and node numbers to names. Lines in this file have the form</p><div class=Bd-indent><pre>

<i>number	name</i>
<span class=Li>1.254		ether</span>
<span class=Li>16.1		icsd-net</span>
<span class=Li>1.254.110	ace</span>

</pre></div> The first two lines give the names of AppleTalk networks. The third line gives the name of a particular host (a host is distinguished from a net by the 3rd octet in the number - a net number <i>must</i> have two octets and a host number <i>must</i> have three octets.) The number and name should be separated by whitespace (blanks or tabs). The <i>/etc/atalk.names</i> file may contain blank lines or comment lines (lines starting with a `#'). <p class=Pp>AppleTalk addresses are printed in the form</p><div class=Bd-indent><pre>

<i>net.host.port</i>
<span class=Li>144.1.209.2 &gt; icsd-net.112.220</span>
<span class=Li>office.2 &gt; icsd-net.112.220</span>
<span class=Li>jssmag.149.235 &gt; icsd-net.2</span>

</pre></div> (If the <i>/etc/atalk.names</i> doesn't exist or doesn't contain an entry for some AppleTalk host/net number, addresses are printed in numeric form.) In the first example, NBP (DDP port 2) on net 144.1 node 209 is sending to whatever is listening on port 220 of net icsd node 112. The second line is the same except the full name of the source node is known (`office'). The third line is a send from port 235 on net jssmag node 149 to broadcast on the icsd-net NBP port (note that the broadcast address (255) is indicated by a net name with no host number - for this reason it's a good idea to keep node names and net names distinct in /etc/atalk.names). <p class=Pp>NBP (name binding protocol) and ATP (AppleTalk transaction protocol) packets have their contents interpreted. Other protocols just dump the protocol name (or number if no name is registered for the protocol) and packet size.</p><p class=Pp><b>NBP packets</b> are formatted like the following examples:</p><div class=Bd-indent><pre>

<span class=Li>icsd-net.112.220 &gt; jssmag.2: nbp-lkup 190: "=:LaserWriter@*"</span>
<span class=Li>jssmag.209.2 &gt; icsd-net.112.220: nbp-reply 190: "RM1140:LaserWriter@*" 250</span>
<span class=Li>techpit.2 &gt; icsd-net.112.220: nbp-reply 190: "techpit:LaserWriter@*" 186</span>

</pre></div> The first line is a name lookup request for laserwriters sent by net icsd host 112 and broadcast on net jssmag. The nbp id for the lookup is 190. The second line shows a reply for this request (note that it has the same id) from host jssmag.209 saying that it has a laserwriter resource named "RM1140" registered on port 250. The third line is another reply to the same request saying host techpit has laserwriter "techpit" registered on port 186. <p class=Pp><b>ATP packet</b> formatting is demonstrated by the following example:</p><div class=Bd-indent><pre>

</pre></div> Jssmag.209 initiates transaction id 12266 with host helios by requesting up to 8 packets (the `&lt;0-7&gt;'). The hex number at the end of the line is the value of the `userdata' field in the request. <p class=Pp>Helios responds with 8 512-byte packets. The `:digit' following the transaction id gives the packet sequence number in the transaction and the number in parens is the amount of data in the packet, excluding the atp header. The `*' on packet 7 indicates that the EOM bit was set.</p><p class=Pp>Jssmag.209 then requests that packets 3 &amp; 5 be retransmitted. Helios resends them then jssmag.209 releases the transaction. Finally, jssmag.209 initiates the next request. The `*' on the request indicates that XO (`exactly once') was <i>not</i> set.</p><p class=Pp></p></section><section class=Sh><h2 class=Sh id=SEE_ALSO><a class=permalink href=#SEE_ALSO>SEE ALSO</a></h2> stty(1), pcap(3PCAP), bpf(4), nit(4P), pcap-savefile(5), pcap-filter(7), pcap-tstamp(7) <p class=Pp></p><div class=Bd-indent><i>http://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/application/vnd.tcpdump.pcap</i></div></section><section class=Sh><h2 class=Sh id=AUTHORS><a class=permalink href=#AUTHORS>AUTHORS</a></h2> The original authors are: <p class=Pp>Van Jacobson, Craig Leres and Steven McCanne, all of the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, University of California, Berkeley, CA.</p><p class=Pp>It is currently being maintained by tcpdump.org.</p><p class=Pp>The current version is available via http:</p><p class=Pp></p><div class=Bd-indent><i>https://www.tcpdump.org/</i></div><p class=Pp>The original distribution is available via anonymous ftp:</p><p class=Pp></p><div class=Bd-indent><i>ftp://ftp.ee.lbl.gov/old/tcpdump.tar.Z</i></div><p class=Pp>IPv6/IPsec support is added by WIDE/KAME project.
