It is a collection of miscellaneous information with little form at this point. Mostly, it is a repository into which you can put information about GNU <code class=Li>ld</code> as you discover it (or as you design changes to <code class=Li>ld</code>). <p class=Pp>This document is distributed under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License. A copy of the license is included in the section entitled "GNU Free Documentation License".</p><p class=Pp></p></div></section><section class=Sh><h2 class=Sh>The <span class=Pa>README File</span></h2> Check the <span class=Pa>README</span> file; it often has useful information that does not appear anywhere else in the directory. </section><section class=Sh><h2 class=Sh id=How_linker_emulations_are_generated><a class=permalink href=#How_linker_emulations_are_generated>How linker emulations are generated</a></h2> Each linker target has an <i class=Em>emulation</i>. The emulation includes the default linker script, and certain emulations also modify certain types of linker behaviour. <p class=Pp>Emulations are created during the build process by the shell script <span class=Pa>genscripts.sh</span>.</p><p class=Pp>The <span class=Pa>genscripts.sh</span> script starts by reading a file in the <span class=Pa>emulparams</span> directory. This is a shell script which sets various shell variables used by <span class=Pa>genscripts.sh</span> and the other shell scripts it invokes.</p><p class=Pp>The <span class=Pa>genscripts.sh</span> script will invoke a shell script in the <span class=Pa>scripttempl</span> directory in order to create default linker scripts written in the linker command language. The <span class=Pa>scripttempl</span> script will be invoked 5 (or, in some cases, 6) times, with different assignments to shell variables, to create different default scripts. The choice of script is made based on the command line options.</p><p class=Pp>After creating the scripts, <span class=Pa>genscripts.sh</span> will invoke yet another shell script, this time in the <span class=Pa>emultempl</span> directory. That shell script will create the emulation source file, which contains C code. This C code permits the linker emulation to override various linker behaviours. Most targets use the generic emulation code, which is in <span class=Pa>emultempl/generic.em</span>.</p><p class=Pp>To summarize, <span class=Pa>genscripts.sh</span> reads three shell scripts: an emulation parameters script in the <span class=Pa>emulparams</span> directory, a linker script generation script in the <span class=Pa>scripttempl</span> directory, and an emulation source file generation script in the <span class=Pa>emultempl</span> directory.</p><p class=Pp>For example, the Sun 4 linker sets up variables in <span class=Pa>emulparams/sun4.sh</span>, creates linker scripts using <span class=Pa>scripttempl/aout.sc</span>, and creates the emulation code using <span class=Pa>emultempl/sunos.em</span>.</p><p class=Pp>Note that the linker can support several emulations simultaneously, depending upon how it is configured. An emulation can be selected with the <code class=Li>-m</code> option. The <code class=Li>-V</code> option will list all supported emulations.</p><section class=Ss><h2 class=Ss><span class=Pa>emulparams scripts</span></h2> Each target selects a particular file in the <span class=Pa>emulparams</span> directory by setting the shell variable <code class=Li>targ_emul</code> in <span class=Pa>configure.tgt</span>. This shell variable is used by the <span class=Pa>configure</span> script to control building an emulation source file. <p class=Pp>Certain conventions are enforced. Suppose the <code class=Li>targ_emul</code> variable is set to <var class=Va>emul</var> in <span class=Pa>configure.tgt</span>. The name of the emulation shell script will be <span class=Pa>emulparams/</span><var class=Va>emul.sh</var>. The <span class=Pa>Makefile</span> must have a target named <span class=Pa>e</span><var class=Va>emul.c</var>; this target must depend upon <span class=Pa>emulparams/</span><var class=Va>emul.sh</var>, as well as the appropriate scripts in the <span class=Pa>scripttempl</span> and <span class=Pa>emultempl</span> directories. The <span class=Pa>Makefile</span> target must invoke <code class=Li>GENSCRIPTS</code> with two arguments: <var class=Va>emul</var>, and the value of the make variable <code class=Li>tdir_</code><var class=Va>emul</var>.

The linker script will use variable substitutions, based on the above variables and those set in the <span class=Pa>emulparams</span> script, to control its behaviour.</p><p class=Pp>When there are parts of the <span class=Pa>scripttempl</span> script which should only be run when doing a final relocation, they should be enclosed within a variable substitution based on <code class=Li>RELOCATING</code>. For example, on many targets special symbols such as <code class=Li>_end</code> should be defined when doing a final link. Naturally, those symbols should not be defined when doing a relocatable link using <code class=Li>-r</code>. The <span class=Pa>scripttempl</span> script could use a construct like this to define those symbols:</p><div class="Bd Pp Bd-indent"><pre>
  ${RELOCATING+ _end = .;}
</pre></div> This will do the symbol assignment only if the <code class=Li>RELOCATING</code> variable is defined. <p class=Pp>The basic job of the linker script is to put the sections in the correct order, and at the correct memory addresses. For some targets, the linker script may have to do some other operations.</p><p class=Pp>For example, on most MIPS platforms, the linker is responsible for defining the special symbol <code class=Li>_gp</code>, used to initialize the <code class=Li>$gp</code> register. It must be set to the start of the small data section plus <code class=Li>0x8000</code>. Naturally, it should only be defined when doing a final relocation. This will typically be done like this:</p><div class="Bd Pp Bd-indent"><pre>
  ${RELOCATING+ _gp = ALIGN(16) + 0x8000;}
</pre></div> This line would appear just before the sections which compose the small data section ( <code class=Li>.sdata</code>, <code class=Li>.sbss</code>). All those sections would be contiguous in memory. <p class=Pp>Many COFF systems build constructor tables in the linker script. The compiler will arrange to output the address of each global constructor in a <code class=Li>.ctor</code> section, and the address of each global destructor in a <code class=Li>.dtor</code> section (this is done by defining <code class=Li>ASM_OUTPUT_CONSTRUCTOR</code> and <code class=Li>ASM_OUTPUT_DESTRUCTOR</code> in the <code class=Li>gcc</code> configuration files). The <code class=Li>gcc</code> runtime support routines expect the constructor table to be named <code class=Li>__CTOR_LIST__</code>. They expect it to be a list of words, with the first word being the count of the number of entries. There should be a trailing zero word. (Actually, the count may be -1 if the trailing word is present, and the trailing word may be omitted if the count is correct, but, as the <code class=Li>gcc</code> behaviour has changed slightly over the years, it is safest to provide both). Here is a typical way that might be handled in a <span class=Pa>scripttempl</span> file.</p><div class="Bd Pp Bd-indent"><pre>
    ${CONSTRUCTING+ __CTOR_LIST__ = .;}
    ${CONSTRUCTING+ LONG((__CTOR_END__ - __CTOR_LIST__) / 4 - 2)}
    ${CONSTRUCTING+ *(.ctors)}
    ${CONSTRUCTING+ LONG(0)}
    ${CONSTRUCTING+ __CTOR_END__ = .;}
    ${CONSTRUCTING+ __DTOR_LIST__ = .;}
    ${CONSTRUCTING+ LONG((__DTOR_END__ - __DTOR_LIST__) / 4 - 2)}
    ${CONSTRUCTING+ *(.dtors)}
    ${CONSTRUCTING+ LONG(0)}
    ${CONSTRUCTING+ __DTOR_END__ = .;}
</pre></div> The use of <code class=Li>CONSTRUCTING</code> ensures that these linker script commands will only appear when the linker is supposed to be building the constructor and destructor tables. This example is written for a target which uses 4 byte pointers. <p class=Pp>Embedded systems often need to set a stack address. This is normally best done by using the <code class=Li>PROVIDE</code> construct with a default stack address. This permits the user to easily override the stack address using the <code class=Li>--defsym</code> option. Here is an example:</p><div class="Bd Pp Bd-indent"><pre>
  ${RELOCATING+ PROVIDE (__stack = 0x80000000);}
</pre></div> The value of the symbol <code class=Li>__stack</code> would then be used in the startup code to initialize the stack pointer. </section><section class=Ss><h2 class=Ss><span class=Pa>emultempl scripts</span></h2> Each linker target uses an <span class=Pa>emultempl</span> script to generate the emulation code.

Typically each function names uses a substitution involving <code class=Li>EMULATION_NAME</code>, for ease of debugging when the linker supports multiple emulations.</p><p class=Pp>Every function and variable in the emitted file should be static.

It will discuss the files you need to be aware of. It will tell you when the given "hooks" in the emulation will be called. It will, hopefully, give you enough information about when and how things happen that you'll be able to get by. As always, the source is the definitive reference to this. <p class=Pp>The starting point for the linker is in <span class=Pa>ldmain.c</span> where <code class=Li>main</code> is defined. The bulk of the code that's emulation specific will initially be in <code class=Li>emultempl/</code><var class=Va>emulation.em</var> but will end up in <code class=Li>e</code><var class=Va>emulation.c</var> when the build is done. Most of the work to select and interface with emulations is in <code class=Li>ldemul.h</code> and <code class=Li>ldemul.c</code>. Specifically, <code class=Li>ldemul.h</code> defines the <code class=Li>ld_emulation_xfer_struct</code> structure your emulation exports.</p><p class=Pp>Your emulation file exports a symbol <code class=Li>ld_</code><var class=Va>EMULATION_NAME_emulation</var>. If your emulation is selected (it usually is, since usually there's only one), <code class=Li>ldemul.c</code> sets the variable <var class=Va>ld_emulation</var> to point to it. <code class=Li>ldemul.c</code> also defines a number of API functions that interface to your emulation, like <code class=Li>ldemul_after_parse</code> which simply calls your <code class=Li>ld_</code><var class=Va>EMULATION_emulation.after_parse</var> function. For the rest of this section, the functions will be mentioned, but you should assume the indirect reference to your emulation also.</p><p class=Pp>We will also skip or gloss over parts of the link process that don't relate to emulations, like setting up internationalization.</p><p class=Pp>After initialization, <code class=Li>main</code> selects an emulation by pre-scanning the command line arguments. It calls <code class=Li>ldemul_choose_target</code> to choose a target. If you set <code class=Li>choose_target</code> to <code class=Li>ldemul_default_target</code>, it picks your <code class=Li>target_name</code> by default.</p><p class=Pp><code class=Li>main</code> calls <code class=Li>ldemul_before_parse</code>, then <code class=Li>parse_args</code>. <code class=Li>parse_args</code> calls <code class=Li>ldemul_parse_args</code> for each arg, which must update the <code class=Li>getopt</code> globals if it recognizes the argument. If the emulation doesn't recognize it, then parse_args checks to see if it recognizes it.</p><p class=Pp>Now that the emulation has had access to all its command-line options, <code class=Li>main</code> calls <code class=Li>ldemul_set_symbols</code>. This can be used for any initialization that may be affected by options. It is also supposed to set up any variables needed by the emulation script.</p><p class=Pp><code class=Li>main</code> now calls <code class=Li>ldemul_get_script</code> to get the emulation script to use (based on arguments, no doubt,see Section “Emulations”) and runs it. While parsing, <code class=Li>ldgram.y</code> may call <code class=Li>ldemul_hll</code> or <code class=Li>ldemul_syslib</code> to handle the <code class=Li>HLL</code> or <code class=Li>SYSLIB</code> commands. It may call <code class=Li>ldemul_unrecognized_file</code> if you asked the linker to link a file it doesn't recognize. It will call <code class=Li>ldemul_recognized_file</code> for each file it does recognize, in case the emulation wants to handle some files specially. All the while, it's loading the files (possibly calling <code class=Li>ldemul_open_dynamic_archive</code>) and symbols and stuff. After it's done reading the script, <code class=Li>main</code> calls <code class=Li>ldemul_after_parse</code>. Use the after-parse hook to set up anything that depends on stuff the script might have set up, like the entry point.</p><p class=Pp><code class=Li>main</code> next calls <code class=Li>lang_process</code> in <code class=Li>ldlang.c</code>. This appears to be the main core of the linking itself, as far as emulation hooks are concerned(*). It first opens the output file's BFD, calling <code class=Li>ldemul_set_output_arch</code>, and calls <code class=Li>ldemul_create_output_section_statements</code> in case you need to use other means to find or create object files (i.e. shared libraries found on a path, or fake stub objects). Despite the name, nobody creates output sections here.</p><p class=Pp>(*) In most cases, the BFD library does the bulk of the actual linking, handling symbol tables, symbol resolution, relocations, and building the final output file. See the BFD reference for all the details. Your emulation is usually concerned more with managing things at the file and section level, like "put this here, add this section", etc.</p><p class=Pp>Next, the objects to be linked are opened and BFDs created for them, and <code class=Li>ldemul_after_open</code> is called. At this point, you have all the objects and symbols loaded, but none of the data has been placed yet.</p><p class=Pp>Next comes the Big Linking Thingy (except for the parts BFD does). All input sections are mapped to output sections according to the script. If a section doesn't get mapped by default, <code class=Li>ldemul_place_orphan</code> will get called to figure out where it goes. Next it figures out the offsets for each section, calling <code class=Li>ldemul_before_allocation</code> before and <code class=Li>ldemul_after_allocation</code> after deciding where each input section ends up in the output sections.</p><p class=Pp>The last part of <code class=Li>lang_process</code> is to figure out all the symbols' values.

I.e., whenever client contains something like</p><p class=Pp><code class=Li>mov dll_var,%eax,</code></p><p class=Pp>address of dll_var in the command should be relocated to point into loaded DLL. The aim is to make OS loader do so, and than make ld help with that. Import section of PE made following way: there's a vector of structures each describing imports from particular DLL. Each such structure points to two other parallel vectors: one holding imported names, and one which will hold address of corresponding imported name. So, the solution is de-vectorize these structures, making import locations be sparse and pointing directly into code.</p><p class=Pp>Implementation</p><p class=Pp>For each reference of data symbol to be imported from DLL (to set of which belong symbols with name &lt;sym&gt;, if __imp_&lt;sym&gt; is found in implib), the import fixup entry is generated. That entry is of type IMAGE_IMPORT_DESCRIPTOR and stored in .idata$3 subsection. Each fixup entry contains pointer to symbol's address within .text section (marked with __fuN_&lt;sym&gt; symbol, where N is integer), pointer to DLL name (so, DLL name is referenced by multiple entries), and pointer to symbol name thunk. Symbol name thunk is singleton vector (__nm_th_&lt;symbol&gt;) pointing to IMAGE_IMPORT_BY_NAME structure (__nm_&lt;symbol&gt;) directly containing imported name. Here comes that "om the edge" problem mentioned above: PE specification rambles that name vector (OriginalFirstThunk) should run in parallel with addresses vector (FirstThunk), i.e. that they should have same number of elements and terminated with zero. We violate this, since FirstThunk points directly into machine code. But in practice, OS loader implemented the sane way: it goes thru OriginalFirstThunk and puts addresses to FirstThunk, not something else. It once again should be noted that dll and symbol name structures are reused across fixup entries and should be there anyway to support standard import stuff, so sustained overhead is 20 bytes per reference. Other question is whether having several IMAGE_IMPORT_DESCRIPTORS for the same DLL is possible. Answer is yes, it is done even by native compiler/linker (libth32's functions are in fact resident in windows9x kernel32.dll, so if you use it, you have two IMAGE_IMPORT_DESCRIPTORS for kernel32.dll). Yet other question is whether referencing the same PE structures several times is valid. The answer is why not, prohibiting that (detecting violation) would require more work on behalf of loader than not doing it.</p></dd></dl></section></section><section class=Sh><h2 class=Sh id=GNU_Free_Documentation_License><a class=permalink href=#GNU_Free_Documentation_License>GNU Free Documentation License</a></h2> GNU Free Documentation License Version 1.1, March 2000 <p class=Pp>Copyright (C) 2000 Free Software Foundation, Inc. 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.</p><p class=Pp>0. PREAMBLE</p><p class=Pp>The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other written document "free" in the sense of freedom: to assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it, with or without modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially. Secondarily, this License preserves for the author and publisher a way to get credit for their work, while not being considered responsible for modifications made by others.</p><p class=Pp>This License is a kind of "copyleft", which means that derivative works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense. It complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft license designed for free software.</p><p class=Pp>We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free software, because free software needs free documentation: a free program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the software does. But this License is not limited to software manuals; it can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or whether it is published as a printed book. We recommend this License principally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference.</p><p class=Pp>1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS</p><p class=Pp>This License applies to any manual or other work that contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be distributed under the terms of this License. The "Document", below, refers to any such manual or work. Any member of the public is a licensee, and is addressed as "you".</p><p class=Pp>A "Modified Version" of the Document means any work containing the Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with modifications and/or translated into another language.</p><p class=Pp>A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a front-matter section of the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall directly within that overall subject. (For example, if the Document is in part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain any mathematics.) The relationship could be a matter of historical connection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal, commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding them.</p><p class=Pp>The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections whose titles are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice that says that the Document is released under this License.</p><p class=Pp>The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text that are listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that the Document is released under this License.</p><p class=Pp>A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy, represented in a format whose specification is available to the general public, whose contents can be viewed and edited directly and straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input to text formatters. A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file format whose markup has been designed to thwart or discourage subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent. A copy that is not "Transparent" is called "Opaque".</p><p class=Pp>Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML or XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple HTML designed for human modification. Opaque formats include PostScript, PDF, proprietary formats that can be read and edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally available, and the machine-generated HTML produced by some word processors for output purposes only.</p><p class=Pp>The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page itself, plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material this License requires to appear in the title page. For works in formats which do not have any title page as such, "Title Page" means the text near the most prominent appearance of the work's title, preceding the beginning of the body of the text.</p><p class=Pp>2. VERBATIM COPYING</p><p class=Pp>You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no other conditions whatsoever to those of this License. You may not use technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further copying of the copies you make or distribute. However, you may accept compensation in exchange for copies. If you distribute a large enough number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3.</p><p class=Pp>You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and you may publicly display copies.</p><p class=Pp>3. COPYING IN QUANTITY</p><p class=Pp>If you publish printed copies of the Document numbering more than 100, and the Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on the back cover. Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify you as the publisher of these copies. The front cover must present the full title with all words of the title equally prominent and visible. You may add other material on the covers in addition. Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve the title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in other respects.</p><p class=Pp>If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent pages.</p><p class=Pp>If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy a publicly-accessible computer-network location containing a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material, which the general network-using public has access to download anonymously at no charge using public-standard network protocols. If you use the latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated location until at least one year after the last time you distribute an Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that edition to the public.</p><p class=Pp>It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the Document.</p><p class=Pp>4. MODIFICATIONS</p><p class=Pp>You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution and modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy of it. In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version:</p><p class=Pp>A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct from that of the Document, and from those of previous versions (which should, if there were any, be listed in the History section of the Document). You may use the same title as a previous version if the original publisher of that version gives permission. B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified Version, together with at least five of the principal authors of the Document (all of its principal authors, if it has less than five). C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the Modified Version, as the publisher. D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document. E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications adjacent to the other copyright notices. F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice giving the public permission to use the Modified Version under the terms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below. G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections and required Cover Texts given in the Document's license notice. H. Include an unaltered copy of this License. I. Preserve the section entitled "History", and its title, and add to it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title Page. If there is no section entitled "History" in the Document, create one stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as given on its Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified Version as stated in the previous sentence. J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise the network locations given in the Document for previous versions it was based on. These may be placed in the "History" section. You may omit a network location for a work that was published at least four years before the Document itself, or if the original publisher of the version it refers to gives permission. K. In any section entitled "Acknowledgements" or "Dedications", preserve the section's title, and preserve in the section all the substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements and/or dedications given therein. L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document, unaltered in their text and in their titles. Section numbers or the equivalent are not considered part of the section titles. M. Delete any section entitled "Endorsements". Such a section may not be included in the Modified Version. N. Do not retitle any existing section as "Endorsements" or to conflict in title with any Invariant Section.</p><p class=Pp>If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material copied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or all of these sections as invariant. To do this, add their titles to the list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version's license notice. These titles must be distinct from any other section titles.</p><p class=Pp>You may add a section entitled "Endorsements", provided it contains nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various parties--for example, statements of peer review or that the text has been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a standard.</p><p class=Pp>You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list of Cover Texts in the Modified Version. Only one passage of Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or through arrangements made by) any one entity. If the Document already includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of, you may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit permission from the previous publisher that added the old one.</p><p class=Pp>The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License give permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or imply endorsement of any Modified Version.</p><p class=Pp>5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS</p><p class=Pp>You may combine the Document with other documents released under this License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified versions, provided that you include in the combination all of the Invariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and list them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its license notice.</p><p class=Pp>The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single copy. If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but different contents, make the title of each such section unique by adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original author or publisher of that section if known, or else a unique number. Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work.</p><p class=Pp>In the combination, you must combine any sections entitled "History" in the various original documents, forming one section entitled "History"; likewise combine any sections entitled "Acknowledgements", and any sections entitled "Dedications". You must delete all sections entitled "Endorsements."</p><p class=Pp>6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS</p><p class=Pp>You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents released under this License, and replace the individual copies of this License in the various documents with a single copy that is included in the collection, provided that you follow the rules of this License for verbatim copying of each of the documents in all other respects.</p><p class=Pp>You may extract a single document from such a collection, and distribute it individually under this License, provided you insert a copy of this License into the extracted document, and follow this License in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of that document.</p><p class=Pp>7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS</p><p class=Pp>A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, does not as a whole count as a Modified Version of the Document, provided no compilation copyright is claimed for the compilation. Such a compilation is called an "aggregate", and this License does not apply to the other self-contained works thus compiled with the Document, on account of their being thus compiled, if they are not themselves derivative works of the Document.</p><p class=Pp>If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one quarter of the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed on covers that surround only the Document within the aggregate. Otherwise they must appear on covers around the whole aggregate.</p><p class=Pp>8. TRANSLATION</p><p class=Pp>Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section 4. Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special permission from their copyright holders, but you may include translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the original versions of these Invariant Sections. You may include a translation of this License provided that you also include the original English version of this License. In case of a disagreement between the translation and the original English version of this License, the original English version will prevail.</p><p class=Pp>9. TERMINATION</p><p class=Pp>You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document except as expressly provided for under this License. Any other attempt to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Document is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.</p><p class=Pp>10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE</p><p class=Pp>The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns. See http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/.</p><p class=Pp>Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number. If the Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that specified version or of any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation. If the Document does not specify a version number of this License, you may choose any version ever published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.</p><p class=Pp>ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents</p><p class=Pp>To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of the License in the document and put the following copyright and license notices just after the title page:</p><div class="Bd Pp Bd-indent"><pre>
