class=permalink href=#DESCRIPTION>DESCRIPTION</a></h2><i>tcsh</i> is an enhanced but completely compatible version of the Berkeley UNIX C shell, <i>csh</i>(1). It is a command language interpreter usable both as an interactive login shell and a shell script command processor. It includes a command-line editor (see <b>The command-line editor</b>), programmable word completion (see <b>Completion and listing</b>), spelling correction (see <b>Spelling correction</b>), a history mechanism (see <b>History substitution</b>), job control (see <b>Jobs</b>) and a C-like syntax. The <b>NEW FEATURES</b> section describes major enhancements of <i>tcsh</i> over <i>csh</i>(1). Throughout this manual, features of <i>tcsh</i> not found in most <i>csh</i>(1) implementations (specifically, the 4.4BSD <i>csh</i>) are labeled with `(+)', and features which are present in <i>csh</i>(1) but not usually documented are labeled with `(u)'. <section class=Ss><h2 class=Ss id=Argument_list_processing><a class=permalink href=#Argument_list_processing>Argument list processing</a></h2> If the first argument (argument 0) to the shell is `-' then it is a login shell. A login shell can be also specified by invoking the shell with the <b>-l</b> flag as the only argument. <p class=Pp>The rest of the flag arguments are interpreted as follows:</p><dl class=Bl-tag><dt><b>-b</b></dt><dd>Forces a ``break'' from option processing, causing any further shell arguments to be treated as non-option arguments. The remaining arguments will not be interpreted as shell options. This may be used to pass options to a shell script without confusion or possible subterfuge. The shell will not run a set-user ID script without this option.</dd><dt><b>-c</b></dt><dd>Commands are read from the following argument (which must be present, and must be a single argument), stored in the <b>command</b> shell variable for reference, and executed. Any remaining arguments are placed in the <b>argv</b> shell variable.</dd><dt><b>-d</b></dt><dd>The shell loads the directory stack from <i>~/.cshdirs</i> as described under <b>Startup and shutdown</b>, whether or not it is a login shell. (+)</dd><dt><b>-D<i>name</i>[=<i>value</i>]</b></dt><dd>Sets the environment variable <i>name</i> to <i>value</i>. (Domain/OS only) (+)</dd><dt><b>-e</b></dt><dd>The shell exits if any invoked command terminates abnormally or yields a non-zero exit status.</dd><dt><b>-f</b></dt><dd>The shell does not load any resource or startup files, or perform any command hashing, and thus starts faster.</dd><dt><b>-F</b></dt><dd>The shell uses <i>fork</i>(2) instead of <i>vfork</i>(2) to spawn processes. (+)</dd><dt><b>-i</b></dt><dd>The shell is interactive and prompts for its top-level input, even if it appears to not be a terminal. Shells are interactive without this option if their inputs and outputs are terminals.</dd><dt><b>-l</b></dt><dd>The shell is a login shell. Applicable only if <b>-l</b> is the only flag specified.</dd><dt><b>-m</b></dt><dd>The shell loads <i>~/.tcshrc</i> even if it does not belong to the effective user. Newer versions of <i>su</i>(1) can pass <b>-m</b> to the shell. (+)</dd><dt><b>-n</b></dt><dd>The shell parses commands but does not execute them. This aids in debugging shell scripts.</dd><dt><b>-q</b></dt><dd>The shell accepts SIGQUIT (see <b>Signal handling</b>) and behaves when it is used under a debugger. Job control is disabled. (u)</dd><dt><b>-s</b></dt><dd>Command input is taken from the standard input.</dd><dt><b>-t</b></dt><dd>The shell reads and executes a single line of input.

The editor is active only when the <b>edit</b> shell variable is set, which it is by default in interactive shells. The <i>bindkey</i> builtin can display and change key bindings. <i>emacs</i>(1)-style key bindings are used by default (unless the shell was compiled otherwise; see the <b>version</b> shell variable), but <i>bindkey</i> can change the key bindings to <i>vi</i>(1)-style bindings en masse. <p class=Pp>The shell always binds the arrow keys (as defined in the <b>TERMCAP</b> environment variable) to</p><p class=Pp></p><div class=Bd-indent><dl class=Bl-tag><dt>down</dt><dd><i>down-history</i></dd><dt>up</dt><dd><i>up-history</i></dd><dt>left</dt><dd><i>backward-char</i></dd><dt>right</dt><dd><i>forward-char</i></dd></dl></div><p class=Pp>unless doing so would alter another single-character binding. One can set the arrow key escape sequences to the empty string with <i>settc</i> to prevent these bindings.

Likewise, <i>bindkey</i> can list the editor commands with a short description of each. Certain key bindings have different behavior depending if <i>emacs</i>(1) or <i>vi</i>(1) style bindings are being used; see <b>vimode</b> for more information.</p><p class=Pp>Note that editor commands do not have the same notion of a ``word'' as does the shell. The editor delimits words with any non-alphanumeric characters not in the shell variable <b>wordchars</b>, while the shell recognizes only whitespace and some of the characters with special meanings to it, listed under <b>Lexical structure</b>.</p></section><section class=Ss><h2 class=Ss id=Completion_and_listing_(+)><a class=permalink href=#Completion_and_listing_(+)>Completion and listing (+)</a></h2> The shell is often able to complete words when given a unique abbreviation. Type part of a word (for example `ls /usr/lost') and hit the tab key to run the <i>complete-word</i> editor command. The shell completes the filename `/usr/lost' to `/usr/lost+found/', replacing the incomplete word with the complete word in the input buffer. (Note the terminal `/'; completion adds a `/' to the end of completed directories and a space to the end of other completed words, to speed typing and provide a visual indicator of successful completion. The <b>addsuffix</b> shell variable can be unset to prevent this.) If no match is found (perhaps `/usr/lost+found' doesn't exist), the terminal bell rings. If the word is already complete (perhaps there is a `/usr/lost' on your system, or perhaps you were thinking too far ahead and typed the whole thing) a `/' or space is added to the end if it isn't already there. <p class=Pp>Completion works anywhere in the line, not at just the end; completed text pushes the rest of the line to the right. Completion in the middle of a word often results in leftover characters to the right of the cursor that need to be deleted.</p><p class=Pp>Commands and variables can be completed in much the same way. For example, typing `em[tab]' would complete `em' to `emacs' if <i>emacs</i> were the only command on your system beginning with `em'. Completion can find a command in any directory in <b>path</b> or if given a full pathname. Typing `echo $ar[tab]' would complete `$ar' to `$argv' if no other variable began with `ar'.</p><p class=Pp>The shell parses the input buffer to determine whether the word you want to complete should be completed as a filename, command or variable. The first word in the buffer and the first word following `;', `|', `|&amp;', `&amp;&amp;' or `||' is considered to be a command. A word beginning with `$' is considered to be a variable. Anything else is a filename. An empty line is `completed' as a filename.</p><p class=Pp>You can list the possible completions of a word at any time by typing `^D' to run the <i>delete-char-or-list-or-eof</i> editor command. The shell lists the possible completions using the <i>ls-F</i> builtin (q.v.) and reprints the prompt and unfinished command line, for example:</p><dl class=Bl-tag><dt></dt><dd>&gt; ls /usr/l[^D] <br> lbin/ lib/ local/ lost+found/ <br> &gt; ls /usr/l</dd></dl><p class=Pp>If the <b>autolist</b> shell variable is set, the shell lists the remaining choices (if any) whenever completion fails:</p><dl class=Bl-tag><dt></dt><dd>&gt; set autolist <br> &gt; nm /usr/lib/libt[tab] <br> libtermcap.a@ libtermlib.a@ <br> &gt; nm /usr/lib/libterm</dd></dl><p class=Pp>If <b>autolist</b> is set to `ambiguous', choices are listed only when completion fails and adds no new characters to the word being completed.</p><p class=Pp>A filename to be completed can contain variables, your own or others' home directories abbreviated with `~' (see <b>Filename substitution</b>) and directory stack entries abbreviated with `=' (see <b>Directory stack substitution</b>). For example,</p><dl class=Bl-tag><dt></dt><dd>&gt; ls ~k[^D] <br> kahn kas kellogg <br> &gt; ls ~ke[tab] <br> &gt; ls ~kellogg/</dd></dl><p class=Pp>or</p><dl class=Bl-tag><dt></dt><dd>&gt; set local = /usr/local <br> &gt; ls $lo[tab] <br> &gt; ls $local/[^D] <br> bin/ etc/ lib/ man/ src/ <br> &gt; ls $local/</dd></dl><p class=Pp>Note that variables can also be expanded explicitly with the <i>expand-variables</i> editor command.</p><p class=Pp><i>delete-char-or-list-or-eof</i> lists at only the end of the line; in the middle of a line it deletes the character under the cursor and on an empty line it logs one out or, if <b>ignoreeof</b> is set, does nothing. `M-^D', bound to the editor command <i>list-choices</i>, lists completion possibilities anywhere on a line, and <i>list-choices</i> (or any one of the related editor commands that do or don't delete, list and/or log out, listed under <i>delete-char-or-list-or-eof</i>) can be bound to `^D' with the <i>bindkey</i> builtin command if so desired.</p><p class=Pp>The <i>complete-word-fwd</i> and <i>complete-word-back</i> editor commands (not bound to any keys by default) can be used to cycle up and down through the list of possible completions, replacing the current word with the next or previous word in the list.</p><p class=Pp>The shell variable <b>fignore</b> can be set to a list of suffixes to be ignored by completion. Consider the following:</p><dl class=Bl-tag><dt></dt><dd>&gt; ls <br> Makefile condiments.h~ main.o side.c <br> README main.c meal side.o <br> condiments.h main.c~ <br> &gt; set fignore = (.o \~) <br> &gt; emacs ma[^D] <br> main.c main.c~ main.o <br> &gt; emacs ma[tab] <br> &gt; emacs main.c</dd></dl><p class=Pp>`main.c~' and `main.o' are ignored by completion (but not listing), because they end in suffixes in <b>fignore</b>. Note that a `\' was needed in front of `~' to prevent it from being expanded to <b>home</b> as described under <b>Filename substitution</b>. <b>fignore</b> is ignored if only one completion is possible.</p><p class=Pp>If the <b>complete</b> shell variable is set to `enhance', completion 1) ignores case and 2) considers periods, hyphens and underscores (`.', `-' and `_') to be word separators and hyphens and underscores to be equivalent. If you had the following files</p><dl class=Bl-tag><dt></dt><dd>comp.lang.c comp.lang.perl comp.std.c++ <br> comp.lang.c++ comp.std.c</dd></dl><p class=Pp>and typed `mail -f c.l.c[tab]', it would be completed to `mail -f comp.lang.c', and ^D would list `comp.lang.c' and `comp.lang.c++'. `mail -f c..c++[^D]' would list `comp.lang.c++' and `comp.std.c++'. Typing `rm a--file[^D]' in the following directory</p><dl class=Bl-tag><dt></dt><dd>A_silly_file a-hyphenated-file another_silly_file</dd></dl><p class=Pp>would list all three files, because case is ignored and hyphens and underscores are equivalent. Periods, however, are not equivalent to hyphens or underscores.</p><p class=Pp>If the <b>complete</b> shell variable is set to `Enhance', completion ignores case and differences between a hyphen and an underscore word separator only when the user types a lowercase character or a hyphen. Entering an uppercase character or an underscore will not match the corresponding lowercase character or hyphen word separator. Typing `rm a--file[^D]' in the directory of the previous example would still list all three files, but typing `rm A--file' would match only `A_silly_file' and typing `rm a__file[^D]' would match just `A_silly_file' and `another_silly_file' because the user explicitly used an uppercase or an underscore character.</p><p class=Pp>Completion and listing are affected by several other shell variables: <b>recexact</b> can be set to complete on the shortest possible unique match, even if more typing might result in a longer match:</p><dl class=Bl-tag><dt></dt><dd>&gt; ls <br> fodder foo food foonly <br> &gt; set recexact <br> &gt; rm fo[tab]</dd></dl><p class=Pp>just beeps, because `fo' could expand to `fod' or `foo', but if we type another `o',</p><dl class=Bl-tag><dt></dt><dd>&gt; rm foo[tab] <br> &gt; rm foo</dd></dl><p class=Pp>the completion completes on `foo', even though `food' and `foonly' also match. <b>autoexpand</b> can be set to run the <i>expand-history</i> editor command before each completion attempt, <b>autocorrect</b> can be set to spelling-correct the word to be completed (see <b>Spelling correction</b>) before each completion attempt and <b>correct</b> can be set to complete commands automatically after one hits `return'. <b>matchbeep</b> can be set to make completion beep or not beep in a variety of situations, and <b>nobeep</b> can be set to never beep at all. <b>nostat</b> can be set to a list of directories and/or patterns that match directories to prevent the completion mechanism from <i>stat</i>(2)ing those directories. <b>listmax</b> and <b>listmaxrows</b> can be set to limit the number of items and rows (respectively) that are listed without asking first. <b>recognize_only_executables</b> can be set to make the shell list only executables when listing commands, but it is quite slow.</p><p class=Pp>Finally, the <i>complete</i> builtin command can be used to tell the shell how to complete words other than filenames, commands and variables. Completion and listing do not work on glob-patterns (see <b>Filename substitution</b>), but the <i>list-glob</i> and <i>expand-glob</i> editor commands perform equivalent functions for glob-patterns.</p></section><section class=Ss><h2 class=Ss id=Spelling_correction_(+)><a class=permalink href=#Spelling_correction_(+)>Spelling correction (+)</a></h2> The shell can sometimes correct the spelling of filenames, commands and variable names as well as completing and listing them. <p class=Pp>Individual words can be spelling-corrected with the <i>spell-word</i> editor command (usually bound to M-s and M-S) and the entire input buffer with <i>spell-line</i> (usually bound to M-$). The <b>correct</b> shell variable can be set to `cmd' to correct the command name or `all' to correct the entire line each time return is typed, and <b>autocorrect</b> can be set to correct the word to be completed before each completion attempt.</p><p class=Pp>When spelling correction is invoked in any of these ways and the shell thinks that any part of the command line is misspelled, it prompts with the corrected line:</p><dl class=Bl-tag><dt></dt><dd>&gt; set correct = cmd <br> &gt; lz /usr/bin <br> CORRECT&gt;ls /usr/bin (y|n|e|a)?</dd></dl><p class=Pp>One can answer `y' or space to execute the corrected line, `e' to leave the uncorrected command in the input buffer, `a' to abort the command as if `^C' had been hit, and anything else to execute the original line unchanged.</p><p class=Pp>Spelling correction recognizes user-defined completions (see the <i>complete</i> builtin command). If an input word in a position for which a completion is defined resembles a word in the completion list, spelling correction registers a misspelling and suggests the latter word as a correction. However, if the input word does not match any of the possible completions for that position, spelling correction does not register a misspelling.</p><p class=Pp>Like completion, spelling correction works anywhere in the line, pushing the rest of the line to the right and possibly leaving extra characters to the right of the cursor.</p></section><section class=Ss><h2 class=Ss id=Editor_commands_(+)><a class=permalink href=#Editor_commands_(+)>Editor commands (+)</a></h2> `bindkey' lists key bindings and `bindkey -l' lists and briefly describes editor commands.

If we didn't care about the order of the `diff' we might have said `diff !-2:1-2' or simply `diff !-2:*'. The `cp' command might have been written `cp wumpus.man !#:1.old', using `#' to refer to the current event. `!n:- hurkle.man' would reuse the first two words from the `nroff' command to say `nroff -man hurkle.man'.</p><p class=Pp>The `:' separating the event specification from the word designator can be omitted if the argument selector begins with a `^', `$', `*', `%' or `-'.

After a command line is parsed into simple commands (see <b>Commands</b>) the first word of each command, left-to-right, is checked to see if it has an alias. If so, the first word is replaced by the alias. If the alias contains a history reference, it undergoes <b>History substitution</b> (q.v.) as though the original command were the previous input line. If the alias does not contain a history reference, the argument list is left untouched. <p class=Pp>Thus if the alias for `ls' were `ls -l' the command `ls /usr' would become `ls -l /usr', the argument list here being undisturbed. If the alias for `lookup' were `grep !^ /etc/passwd' then `lookup bill' would become `grep bill /etc/passwd'. Aliases can be used to introduce parser metasyntax. For example, `alias print 'pr \!* | lpr'' defines a ``command'' (`print') which <i>pr</i>(1)s its arguments to the line printer.</p><p class=Pp>Alias substitution is repeated until the first word of the command has no alias. If an alias substitution does not change the first word (as in the previous example) it is flagged to prevent a loop.

These can be displayed and changed with <i>printenv</i>, <i>setenv</i> and <i>unsetenv</i>. <p class=Pp>(+) Variables may be made read-only with `set -r' (q.v.). Read-only variables may not be modified or unset; attempting to do so will cause an error. Once made read-only, a variable cannot be made writable, so `set -r' should be used with caution. Environment variables cannot be made read-only.</p><p class=Pp>Some variables are set by the shell or referred to by it. For instance, the <b>argv</b> variable is an image of the shell's argument list, and words of this variable's value are referred to in special ways. Some of the variables referred to by the shell are toggles; the shell does not care what their value is, only whether they are set or not. For instance, the <b>verbose</b> variable is a toggle which causes command input to be echoed. The <b>-v</b> command line option sets this variable. <b>Special shell variables</b> lists all variables which are referred to by the shell.</p><p class=Pp>Other operations treat variables numerically. The `@' command permits numeric calculations to be performed and the result assigned to a variable. Variable values are, however, always represented as (zero or more) strings. For the purposes of numeric operations, the null string is considered to be zero, and the second and subsequent words of multi-word values are ignored.</p><p class=Pp>After the input line is aliased and parsed, and before each command is executed, variable substitution is performed keyed by `$' characters. This expansion can be prevented by preceding the `$' with a `\' except within `"'s where it <i>always</i> occurs, and within `''s where it <i>never</i> occurs. Strings quoted by ``' are interpreted later (see <b>Command substitution</b> below) so `$' substitution does not occur there until later, if at all. A `$' is passed unchanged if followed by a blank, tab, or end-of-line.</p><p class=Pp>Input/output redirections are recognized before variable expansion, and are variable expanded separately. Otherwise, the command name and entire argument list are expanded together. It is thus possible for the first (command) word (to this point) to generate more than one word, the first of which becomes the command name, and the rest of which become arguments.</p><p class=Pp>Unless enclosed in `"' or given the `:q' modifier the results of variable substitution may eventually be command and filename substituted. Within `"', a variable whose value consists of multiple words expands to a (portion of a) single word, with the words of the variable's value separated by blanks.

If the character `~' is followed by a character other than a letter or `/' or appears elsewhere than at the beginning of a word, it is left undisturbed.

If used by itself, it will match zero or more sub-directories (e.g. `ls /usr/include/**/time.h' will list any file named `time.h' in the /usr/include directory tree; `ls /usr/include/**time.h' will match any file in the /usr/include directory tree ending in `time.h'; and `ls /usr/include/**time**.h' will match any .h file with `time' either in a subdirectory name or in the filename itself).

Each word in the variable <b>path</b> names a directory in which the shell will look for the command. If the shell is not given a <b>-f</b> option, the shell hashes the names in these directories into an internal table so that it will try an <i>execve</i>(2) in only a directory where there is a possibility that the command resides there. This greatly speeds command location when a large number of directories are present in the search path. This hashing mechanism is not used:</p><dl class=Bl-tag><dt><b>1.</b></dt><dd>If hashing is turned explicitly off via <i>unhash</i>.</dd><dt><b>2.</b></dt><dd>If the shell was given a <b>-f</b> argument.</dd><dt><b>3.</b></dt><dd>For each directory component of <b>path</b> which does not begin with a `/'.</dd><dt><b>4.</b></dt><dd>If the command contains a `/'.</dd></dl><p class=Pp>In the above four cases the shell concatenates each component of the path vector with the given command name to form a path name of a file which it then attempts to execute it.

The `&lt;&lt;' mechanism should be used to present inline data. This permits shell command scripts to function as components of pipelines and allows the shell to block read its input. Note that the default standard input for a command run detached is <i>not</i> the empty file <i>/dev/null</i>, but the original standard input of the shell. If this is a terminal and if the process attempts to read from the terminal, then the process will block and the user will be notified (see <b>Jobs</b>).</p><p class=Pp>Diagnostic output may be directed through a pipe with the standard output.

It keeps a table of current jobs, printed by the <i>jobs</i> command, and assigns them small integer numbers. When a job is started asynchronously with `&amp;', the shell prints a line which looks like <dl class=Bl-tag><dt></dt><dd>[1] 1234</dd></dl><p class=Pp>indicating that the job which was started asynchronously was job number 1 and had one (top-level) process, whose process id was 1234.</p><p class=Pp>If you are running a job and wish to do something else you may hit the suspend key (usually `^Z'), which sends a STOP signal to the current job. The shell will then normally indicate that the job has been `Suspended' and print another prompt. If the <b>listjobs</b> shell variable is set, all jobs will be listed like the <i>jobs</i> builtin command; if it is set to `long' the listing will be in long format, like `jobs -l'. You can then manipulate the state of the suspended job. You can put it in the ``background'' with the <i>bg</i> command or run some other commands and eventually bring the job back into the ``foreground'' with <i>fg</i>. (See also the <i>run-fg-editor</i> editor command.) A `^Z' takes effect immediately and is like an interrupt in that pending output and unread input are discarded when it is typed. The <i>wait</i> builtin command causes the shell to wait for all background jobs to complete.</p><p class=Pp>The `^]' key sends a delayed suspend signal, which does not generate a STOP signal until a program attempts to <i>read</i>(2) it, to the current job. This can usefully be typed ahead when you have prepared some commands for a job which you wish to stop after it has read them. The `^Y' key performs this function in <i>csh</i>(1); in <i>tcsh</i>, `^Y' is an editing command. (+)</p><p class=Pp>A job being run in the background stops if it tries to read from the terminal. Background jobs are normally allowed to produce output, but this can be disabled by giving the command `stty tostop'. If you set this tty option, then background jobs will stop when they try to produce output like they do when they try to read input.</p><p class=Pp>There are several ways to refer to jobs in the shell. The character `%' introduces a job name. If you wish to refer to job number 1, you can name it as `%1'. Just naming a job brings it to the foreground; thus `%1' is a synonym for `fg %1', bringing job 1 back into the foreground. Similarly, saying `%1 &amp;' resumes job 1 in the background, just like `bg %1'. A job can also be named by an unambiguous prefix of the string typed in to start it: `%ex' would normally restart a suspended <i>ex</i>(1) job, if there were only one suspended job whose name began with the string `ex'. It is also possible to say `%?<i>string</i>' to specify a job whose text contains <i>string</i>, if there is only one such job.</p><p class=Pp>The shell maintains a notion of the current and previous jobs. In output pertaining to jobs, the current job is marked with a `+' and the previous job with a `-'. The abbreviations `%+', `%', and (by analogy with the syntax of the <i>history</i> mechanism) `%%' all refer to the current job, and `%-' refers to the previous job.</p><p class=Pp>The job control mechanism requires that the <i>stty</i>(1) option `new' be set on some systems. It is an artifact from a `new' implementation of the tty driver which allows generation of interrupt characters from the keyboard to tell jobs to stop.

It normally informs you whenever a job becomes blocked so that no further progress is possible, but only right before it prints a prompt. This is done so that it does not otherwise disturb your work. If, however, you set the shell variable <b>notify</b>, the shell will notify you immediately of changes of status in background jobs. There is also a shell command <i>notify</i> which marks a single process so that its status changes will be immediately reported. By default <i>notify</i> marks the current process; simply say `notify' after starting a background job to mark it. <p class=Pp>When you try to leave the shell while jobs are stopped, you will be warned that `There are suspended jobs.' You may use the <i>jobs</i> command to see what they are.

NLS support differs depending on whether or not the shell was compiled to use the system's NLS (again, see <b>version</b>). In either case, 7-bit ASCII is the default character code (e.g., the classification of which characters are printable) and sorting, and changing the <b>LANG</b> or <b>LC_CTYPE</b> environment variables causes a check for possible changes in these respects. <p class=Pp>When using the system's NLS, the <i>setlocale</i>(3) function is called to determine appropriate character code/classification and sorting (e.g., a 'en_CA.UTF-8' would yield "UTF-8" as a character code). This function typically examines the <b>LANG</b> and <b>LC_CTYPE</b> environment variables; refer to the system documentation for further details. When not using the system's NLS, the shell simulates it by assuming that the ISO 8859-1 character set is used whenever either of the <b>LANG</b> and <b>LC_CTYPE</b> variables are set, regardless of their values. Sorting is not affected for the simulated NLS.</p><p class=Pp>In addition, with both real and simulated NLS, all printable characters in the range \200-\377, i.e., those that have M-<i>char</i> bindings, are automatically rebound to <i>self-insert-command</i>. The corresponding binding for the escape-<i>char</i> sequence, if any, is left alone. These characters are not rebound if the <b>NOREBIND</b> environment variable is set. This may be useful for the simulated NLS or a primitive real NLS which assumes full ISO 8859-1. Otherwise, all M-<i>char</i> bindings in the range \240-\377 are effectively undone. Explicitly rebinding the relevant keys with <i>bindkey</i> is of course still possible.</p><p class=Pp>Unknown characters (i.e., those that are neither printable nor control characters) are printed in the format \nnn. If the tty is not in 8 bit mode, other 8 bit characters are printed by converting them to ASCII and using standout mode. The shell never changes the 7/8 bit mode of the tty and tracks user-initiated changes of 7/8 bit mode. NLS users (or, for that matter, those who want to use a meta key) may need to explicitly set the tty in 8 bit mode through the appropriate <i>stty</i>(1) command in, e.g., the <i>~/.login</i> file.</p></section><section class=Ss><h2 class=Ss id=OS_variant_support_(+)><a class=permalink href=#OS_variant_support_(+)>OS variant support (+)</a></h2> A number of new builtin commands are provided to support features in particular operating systems.

These are particularly useful when sharing one's home directory between several types of machines; one can, for example,</p><dl class=Bl-tag><dt></dt><dd>set path = (~/bin.$MACHTYPE /usr/ucb /bin /usr/bin .)</dd></dl><p class=Pp>in one's <i>~/.login</i> and put executables compiled for each machine in the appropriate directory.</p><p class=Pp>The <b>version</b> shell variable indicates what options were chosen when the shell was compiled.</p><p class=Pp>Note also the <i>newgrp</i> builtin, the <b>afsuser</b> and <b>echo_style</b> shell variables and the system-dependent locations of the shell's input files (see <b>FILES</b>).</p></section><section class=Ss><h2 class=Ss id=Signal_handling><a class=permalink href=#Signal_handling>Signal handling</a></h2> Login shells ignore interrupts when reading the file <i>~/.logout</i>. The shell ignores quit signals unless started with <b>-q</b>. Login shells catch the terminate signal, but non-login shells inherit the terminate behavior from their parents. Other signals have the values which the shell inherited from its parent. <p class=Pp>In shell scripts, the shell's handling of interrupt and terminate signals can be controlled with <i>onintr</i>, and its handling of hangups can be controlled with <i>hup</i> and <i>nohup</i>.</p><p class=Pp>The shell exits on a hangup (see also the <b>logout</b> shell variable). By default, the shell's children do too, but the shell does not send them a hangup when it exits. <i>hup</i> arranges for the shell to send a hangup to a child when it exits, and <i>nohup</i> sets a child to ignore hangups.</p></section><section class=Ss><h2 class=Ss id=Terminal_management_(+)><a class=permalink href=#Terminal_management_(+)>Terminal management (+)</a></h2> The shell uses three different sets of terminal (``tty'') modes: `edit', used when editing, `quote', used when quoting literal characters, and `execute', used when executing commands. The shell holds some settings in each mode constant, so commands which leave the tty in a confused state do not interfere with the shell. The shell also matches changes in the speed and padding of the tty. The list of tty modes that are kept constant can be examined and modified with the <i>setty</i> builtin. Note that although the editor uses CBREAK mode (or its equivalent), it takes typed-ahead characters anyway. <p class=Pp>The <i>echotc</i>, <i>settc</i> and <i>telltc</i> commands can be used to manipulate and debug terminal capabilities from the command line.</p><p class=Pp>On systems that support SIGWINCH or SIGWINDOW, the shell adapts to window resizing automatically and adjusts the environment variables <b>LINES</b> and <b>COLUMNS</b> if set. If the environment variable <b>TERMCAP</b> contains li# and co# fields, the shell adjusts them to reflect the new window size.</p></section></section><section class=Sh><h2 class=Sh id=REFERENCE><a class=permalink href=#REFERENCE>REFERENCE</a></h2> The next sections of this manual describe all of the available <b>Builtin commands</b>, <b>Special aliases</b> and <b>Special shell variables</b>. <section class=Ss><h2 class=Ss id=Builtin_commands><a class=permalink href=#Builtin_commands>Builtin commands</a></h2><dl class=Bl-tag><dt><b>%<i>job</i></b></dt><dd>A synonym for the <i>fg</i> builtin command.</dd><dt><b>%<i>job </i><b>&amp;</b></b></dt><dd>A synonym for the <i>bg</i> builtin command.</dd><dt><b>:</b></dt><dd>Does nothing, successfully.</dd></dl><p class=Pp><b>@</b><br><b>@ <i>name</i><b> = </b><i>expr</i></b><br><b>@ <i>name</i>[<i>index</i>]<b> = </b><i>expr</i></b><br><b>@ <i>name</i><b>++</b>|<b>--</b></b></p><dl class=Bl-tag><dt><b>@ <i>name</i>[<i>index</i>]<b>++</b>|<b>--</b></b></dt><dd>The first form prints the values of all shell variables.</dd></dl><div class=Bd-indent><p class=Pp>The second form assigns the value of <i>expr</i> to <i>name</i>.

For example, the Elm mail program uses `=' as an abbreviation for one's mail directory. One might use</p><dl class=Bl-tag><dt></dt><dd>&gt; complete elm c@=@F:$HOME/Mail/@</dd></dl><p class=Pp>to complete `elm -f =' as if it were `elm -f ~/Mail/'. Note that we used `@' instead of `/' to avoid confusion with the <i>select</i> argument, and we used `$HOME' instead of `~' because home directory substitution works at only the beginning of a word.</p><p class=Pp><i>suffix</i> is used to add a nonstandard suffix (not space or `/' for directories) to completed words.</p><dl class=Bl-tag><dt></dt><dd>&gt; complete finger 'c/*@/$hostnames/' 'p/1/u/@'</dd></dl><p class=Pp>completes arguments to `finger' from the list of users, appends an `@', and then completes after the `@' from the `hostnames' variable.

While this setting is usually the most convenient, it is sometimes misleading and sometimes confusing when it fails to recognize an argument which should be expanded.

Command sequences of the form `a ; b ; c' are also not handled gracefully when stopping is attempted. If you suspend `b', the shell will then immediately execute `c'. This is especially noticeable if this expansion results from an <i>alias</i>. It suffices to place the sequence of commands in ()'s to force it to a subshell, i.e., `( a ; b ; c )'.</p><p class=Pp>Control over tty output after processes are started is primitive; perhaps this will inspire someone to work on a good virtual terminal interface.
