					<b>Full OS forked from <strong>FreeBSD</strong>.</b><br><br>
					Goal is to keep the the two codebases as similar as possible, but minor differences do exist.<br><br>
					<a href = "https://github.com/inobulles/aquabsd-core">core</a> is split into two parts: <strong>kernel</strong> (OS kernel in the traditional sense), and <strong>base</strong> (set of user programs necessary to, well, do anything üòÑ).

				<p>
					<b>Centralized application repository & automatic updates.</b><br><br>
					<strong>ZPK</strong> application package format, which guarantees (inch'Allah) that dependency issues don't cause breakage.<br><br>
					<strong>aquarium</strong> system for running <strong>Linux-native</strong> programs, as well as providing quick-to-setup virtual environments to work with.

				</div>
				<p>
					<b>Easy to use graphical installer.</b><br><br>
					Small image sizes (<strong>&lt;100 MB</strong>) and quick installation thanks to concurrency and pre-downloading.<br><br>
					Aim is to reduce time between initial decision to install <strong>aquaBSD</strong> and having something up and running to a minimum.
